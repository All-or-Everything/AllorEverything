# Intramutualism: A New Economic System
## Changes
- Open Innovation: Intellectual property is dropped entirely. Instead, inventors and potential sponsors are acknowledged in the filing of an invention, but not given exclusive control over its use. Instead, to incentivize innovation, there are direct funding incentives. These would actually produce more concrete incentives, because they mean that inventors could actually make a living off of their inventions without taking excessive risk or requiring excessive up-front investment. Being an inventor would finally be an actual stable job, and companies could compete fairly without patent battles. Public databases would freely allow access and use of the greatest innovations of humanity. Also, schooling quality would dramatically increase, as all the proprietary information in textbooks and other paid courses would, by the nature of this policy, be phased out and replaced with Open Educational Resources (OER) alongside, which are higher quality and free for public access.
- Standardization: Do we really need 500 different kind of power tool batteries and chargers when one would suffice? As the logical next step to supplanting intellectual property, the pool of open innovation are drawn from to form industry standards across industries, which are enforced, ensuring compatibility between products regardless of producer. 
- Priority: Instead of stockholder return on investment and profitability largely determining the amount that can be spent developing the capacity to produce something, the return on investment for the good of society would determine the level of funds granted, accounting for indirect effects. With this would come the need for new, more complicated metrics of value to be created. While difficult, it is necessary, as it would task us with figuring out how to determine value with consistency in general. The resulting metrics, when informing decisions, would serve a lot more essential human needs than metrics like GDP, reflecting more accurately the lived experience and quality of life, both of which would be pursued more directly and thus improved significantly as a result, bringing productivity and innovation up with it.
Services like Wikipedia, which provide greater economic benefit than they could ever recieve in standard capitalism, would increase in numbers and funding.. exponentially. The greater good would become the most successful business plan to pursue in such an economy. There would be no more lying public relations team that hides atrocities, because moral and progressive goals would be the uniting base of all businessmen. Also, investors would still be in luck. They would work alongside economists as the deciding parties behind investment and funds allocation in the economy, but with different incentives now.
It would be a system where the government supports the economy, the economy supports the people, and the people support both. It is truly intramutual, where all sectors unite for the common good to benefit all.

It may have some similar aspects to Socialism, though it was inspired partially by [some ideas from different economic systems and theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_economics) off of Wikipedia, and boy are there a lot of those.

However, I did not really use any single theory as my baseline. Instead, I asked myself a question: What would the most efficient model for economic activity and development look like?

In standard capitalism, the dominant economic practice, perverse incentives shoot up like weeds everywhere. This system demonstrates a better option to what is currently in place, as it would remove these perverse incentives, weeding out:
- Scams like bait & switch, NFT grifting, among many other annoying and/or shady practices that rely on misleading advertising.
- Pharmeceutical profiteering, which comes at at the expense of those suffering from debilitating illnesses.
- The requirement of individual payment for simple online services of low cost and general public benifit. Think paywalls.
- The over-proliferation of advertisements shown instead of, as a barrier to reaching, or distracting from, the relavent content.
- The excessive focus on profits over usefulness, curating products to get people to pay more for them rather than for them to be more useful. Think smartphone manufacturers removing the headphone jack and SD card slot when these components offer far more functionality and present negligible downsides, simply to juice sales of their more profitable bluetooth headphones lineups (which provide lower quality audio fundimentally due to the medium of transfer) and their more expensive, higher storage capacity phone models.
- The ability of intellectual property holders to sue or charge royalties for a wide range of things, including even simply singing the song "Happy Birthday" in public.
- The incentive for companies to make so you can't fix products [that you paid for](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair), as well as the ability for them to even do so to begin with.

It was implied but not stated that there would be less inequality in such a system. The system would, in any case, trend towards equality if implemented. Less inequality is more efficient in economics for the following reasons:
 - Resource allocation is much more efficient and fair. Because there is not as large of a divide between rich and poor, there would be less people spending money on extravagant things that aren't of much practical value simply because they have too much money to know how to use properly, and at the same time more people with financial means to pay for basic needs and achieve further growth (reducing poverty as well).
 - It helps prevent oligarchy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_law_of_oligarchy)
 - It keeps the motives of the economy aligned with the motives of the people.
 - It provides political stability.
 - It's simply more fair.
I came up with these on the fly, without looking anything up, so there are very likely many more reasons. Simply put, there are many practical and evolutionary reasons equality is a moral value.

Note also that there will be no economic system designed by me, be it this or any other, that will include intellectual property as it currently stands because:
- It stifles innovation despite incentivizing it, by preventing the widespread implimentation of, or further innovation on, previous inventions.
- It is incredibly difficult to regulate in a way that is fair for everyone, because the conflicts between patents create gray areas on top of gray areas.
- It is anticompetitive by nature, a quality which is fundimentally incompatible with a balanced market system.
- The reward for a given invention is more random, and rather than being aligned with the benifit derived from its use, it's more so determined by how saavy one is at marketing their invention.
- Sharing ideas is what makes society progress. Hoarding ideas, as with hoarding anything else in the economy, makes things worse.
- The most common usage of intellectual property in modern times runs starkly counter to the initial intentions of the concept, as it is commonly and increasingly misused by large corperations to maintain monopolies by gaining strategic leverage over other companies, rather than to provide a reward to small innovators, and the actual inventors nowadays are individuals working at these monopolies who get no rights to their creations.
That is not to say there should be no program in place to benefit the inventor of the idea, but that the system must be well thought out.


This economic system runs on a self-balancing system of currency, like capitalism, but the incentives are held under strong collective control. This is done through a sophisticated system of measurement, calculation, and calibration, and the prices are regulated so that the profit margin matches the value provided to the buyer in their good or service. Likewise, the provision of goods and services are subsidized according to their positive externalities for the public, and taxed according to their negative externalities.

Demonstrative example: There is a database of knowledge that anyone can access. However, much of the information is technical and advanced, thus discouraging the average person from using it for their ideas. If indications predict that providing a more intuitive and approachable system to interact with this information is in the best interests of the people, and would give more to society (in positive externalities) than it would take away (in time and costs) such a system would be developed. Supply follows societal demands.

Many ideas have been thought up and subsequently dismissed because although they would benefit society (and the economy) as a whole, they would not turn a profit. These are good ideas that are wasted, discarded as useless by companies who cannot monetize the public good.

Capitalism has its benefits, absolutely. It's not adequate anymore though. It has been milked dry over the past centuries and is stagnating. The opposite of stagnation is change, which is best done with eyes clear of ideological dogmas. I don't care if an economy is capitalism or socialism or any other ideology for that matter: I care if it works.

Now, assuming one could distribute wealth to a population, how would it be distributed most efficiently to achieve the greater good? I realized that, assuming everyone has average intelligence (IQ settles into a normal distribution, or 'bell curve' in reality), it would be most efficient to distribute funds equally, as everyone can allocate funds optimally with equal funds given equal intelligence. This would improve a society dramatically... if it was a monolith. Society is, howerver, not a monolith, and this in practice would be a bad idea, providing no incentive for individuals to contribute in any way to the system they depend on to stay alive.

That being said, there is a place where equality is well suited. Consider the things in the economy which are too critical, when it comes to enabling the bare minimum of a humane existence, to withhold from anyone, period. These things must always be provided without cost and under no circumstances be withheld for the purpose of increasing worker incentive. In effect, witholding these things result in a form of coercion which can be summed up as blackmail-induced slavery. It is well known that, regardless of the form, and regardless of the mechanisms facilitating it, slavery degrades both the people and the economy itself. Desperation is not a sustainable or acceptable incentive.

We need our needs met without excuses or delays. This is the most fundimentally important aspect for any society to prioritize. In light of this, let's consider a policy to do so. To provide for our most fundimental basic needs, we need Universal Basic Necessities. UBN is a policy of providing all the basic necessities for life such as food, water, shelter, education, healthcare, and any other non-negotiable human needs, without question or hesitation. This provides a stable base to build a strong economy off of.

This, however, is not where we end, because even while UBN is implimented, it remains useful to provide everyone a baseline average allowance, calculated in order to leverage some advantages of the increase in resource distribution efficiency. This is Universal Basic Income, and it helps redistribute wealth to those that it means the most to. This should be implimented with due consideration that it is balanced, without too significantly diminishing the incentive to be productive within the economy, while also providing everyone with an allowance.

Incentives could come in the form of the currently existing system, but there are more clever and effective ways to implement incentives. When an individual makes an invention or does a project (or really just anything) that is helpful to society and/or economic progress, they could be compensated for it in cash and social status, by both institutions built for that purpose and maybe also other people if they choose to do so, because gratitude is good for society. It could even lead to a culture of paying back good deeds in full, strengthening cohesion in communities and giving those that engage in such projects a driving social motivation from the knowledge people support their ventures, along with the material support and incentive already in place.

Those that are successful would be the inspiration and example for the following ventures, which would build upon the work of previous startups. Corporations could sprout up to increase efficiency and thus funding and status of the founder, and all workers would get paid well so long as they are contributing to society in their role. The founder would also get a bonus per person that is contributing to society more efficiently than they would be doing otherwise without the company. This is somewhat capitalist and socialist (i.e. owners own their companies, but within boundaries. Strict limitations are in place to prevent abuse of power; competition happens - and it happens more efficiently, towards progress, thanks to the recalibration of incentives; people can earn more money by working harder - so long as their work actually benifits others;) so this shows promise towards fixing the problems of capitalism. For inventions, they would be open to public use and access but would give credit to the inventor. The inventor would then be compensated based on predictions of how much their invention has improved society, which means that not only would there be incentives for inventions, but also that they would mainly be geared towards the common good.

Essentially, in a system that rewards good deeds the amount of effort geared towards helping the greater good would skyrocket. For once, we could all be on the same page.

Further on the topic of wage distribution, how should one distribute pay? Well, it would be calculated by the statistics division of government. All companies would have to report sales and other metrics to the analytics division of government, which would use those and many other factors in calculations in order to make sound economic predictions and provide an optimal economic plan for the greater good of society, including where money goes, how much, and other factors. Machine learning technology would likely be utilized to reduce workload and increase effectiveness.

On a different note, in my drawing I drew the 'communication and oversight' branch of government being connected to each other branch of government. That is actually not arbitrary, but it would be functional in order to make sure all information passes through the same place so information is well organized and multilateral, it would change the conditions so political power is nearly impossible to acquire within the government, and it would dramatically simplify the process of making decisions. Also, the government would be designed so that mistakes, lies, or corruption would be easily detected and managed.

#### Financial Fabrication
The money in the economy should not be mistaken as the economy itself, just as a map should not be mistaken as the terrain itself. GDP is not as important as social outcomes that have tangible effects on people's lives.

## The Economy and Time

In the economy time is, in many practical ways, similar to any spatial dimension. For example, in its simplest manifestation, expanding a farm by a factor of 2 in any one dimension will double output, as would increasing it by 2 temporally (i.e. twice the speed).

The difference between time and other dimensions is that with more complex systems, differences of functionality occur. If we look at a microprocessor, increasing speed will increase the amount of instructions per second. However, increasing size can increase the amount of memory stored and the complexity of the calculations it is capable of performing, which translates to increasing the amount of instructions per second and possibly more functional diversity.

Similar to the clock speed vs core count, the speed of any system almost always reaches a point where increasing it any further breaks things, and the scale of a system is always limited by the ability to co-ordinate all the different parts of the system. Speed in a sector can be increased marginally by finding shortcuts (i.e. innovations that remove, replace, or speed up part of the process), improving quality (via training, improved protocols, higher skill workers, etc.), or by cutting corners (lowering quality, not recommended except for in areas that are non-critical and/or excessively over-engineered/over-emphasized to little gain), which will increase output.

Size is simply increased by increasing the scale of a sector. This means that with more workers, provided co-ordination and management are sufficient, there will be more output (whether that output is innovation, production, or some other economic good), more rapid development, and other advantages caused by network effect/the fact that people were biologically designed with the capacity to scale up into communities. Effects like these can be seen in many places in the economy, and for such reasons coordination is of great importance.

## Encompassing Economics

The economy encompasses all. Not many bother with the small details, but they add up. For example, in the U.S. we have a poorly functioning justice system that arrests 5x the international average. Many of these are people that could otherwise be contributing to the economy, but instead they are held in custody, which actually costs a significant amount, especially for the poor treatment the prisoners get out of it.

It also encompasses school, where teachers teach and students learn. The effect the teaching has on the students will have a subsequent effect on the economy, so lessons should be high quality, and good schooling should be accessible to all regardless of socioeconomic status.

Even things seemingly unrelated such as health, social justice, political stability, and social investment can have an impact on the economy. Wars, politics, culture, ideology, climate, and other factors all play a large role in shaping what the economy looks like. There is almost nothing that does not affect the economy to some extent, whether it be a new discovery, a popular trend, a geopolitical event, etcetera. The question is, what kind of effects can these events have? Which help and which hinder the economy?

How can we elegantly intertwine politics, geography, and all other factors with the economy, such that the optimal actions are persued for the good of all?

## Concepts of Collective Convenience

### Dinner Delivery

We have limited time, and every bit of time spent on meaningful things in life is important. Additionally,  not all of us like having too many choices to choose between, as it saturates our thought processes. For that reason, I think it would be ideal to have a system of getting meals directly.

I dislike the fact that, even with modern-day convenience, the closest thing we have to my ideal system, as far as I am aware, is the company Hello Fresh. Not really a good start. I dislike Hello Fresh for several reasons, but it will serve as a good comparison to demonstrate how I conceptualize this direct meal system.

First, let's talk about the food served. I don't like the food that Hello Fresh provides. My parents had a subscription to it for a while, and the experience was mediocre at best. The food was not good, in my experience, because it consisted of meals I could not pronounce or recognize, which also tasted strange to me, and not in a good way. Additionally, the food was not pre-prepared, thus ruining the point of the service to begin with. At that point why not just buy the ingredients from the supermarket?

A meal distribution system in Intramutualism would have pre-prepared, cooked food. The food of choice could potentially be selected among a group of popular options, subject to public preference, and would be cooked locally. It would likely be more readily available in cities, as it would be easier to distribute food to many in a dense urban environment, but with good logistics it could potentially be a possibility in the country as well. This would save a significant amount of time having to go grocery shopping, preparing food, and cleaning up afterwards.

Even with it being more convenient, the quality of food would likely be better anyway, thus one does not need to sacrifice quality for convenience. One can have both. One can additionally have healthy food that also tastes good, thus helping with current health issues. Of course, one could skip the convenience and just buy from the store, but most would likely opt for the convenient option. It would make food distribution more efficient.

If it's good food and people like it it, they may decide to have all of their meals provided the meal distribution system. This removes the need to have an oven or to cook, for the most part, and thus houses can be a bit smaller, less cluttered, and more manageable. It also means far less pantry space would be needed, refrigerators would not need to be as large, the oven, stovetop, and/or microwave may be unneeded, food would spoil less while in storage, and saved time means people could focus their efforts in other places, which inevitably improves the economy, as well as quality of life.

### Helping Homes

Additionally, services that help with things like home management and organization would be important as well. They have many tangible benefits both personal and economical. For what reason should we think only we alone can manage our lives, even if it is in chaos? Because that is what is expected. It is, however, not necessary, indeed not even desirable, if one wants to be able to manage their life without falling apart.

Unlike having a (notably toxic and exploitative) self-help industry, we could have an industry that specializes on actually helping people improve their daily lives, whether it be by relaying tangible life skills that are proven to be helpful, by organizing and/or reorganizing everything from someone's house to their computer files, and all in between. This means helping people with skills they need for day-to-day life to make it easier, thus freeing up time and improving things economically and personally.

Things like these can't currently be pursued with plain capitalism because capitalism asks for an immediate monetary reward. Intramutualism has a specific focus how things effect the economy as a whole. It is more based on systems science. As such, things that don't net capital but do improve the economy as a whole will be pursued, thus it is unlikely to put profit over people and the overall economy. Also, upwards mobility is baked into the system.

> The founder would also get a bonus per person that is contributing to society more efficiently than they would be doing otherwise without the company.

This means that if a company is more efficiently contributing to society than some other company, that company is incentivised to hire those that are working in less efficient jobs. Because workers would be paid a majority percentage of the value their work, more efficient work means a higher paying job. In both cases, incentives select for greater efficiency/effectiveness along with increasing wages. Also, bringing a worker from a higher efficiency job to a lower efficiency job would likely carry a penalty, and it would also pay a lower wage, so lowering wages would be selected against. Importantly, it would actively bring people from low-productivity jobs into higher-productivity jobs. This is like the free hand of the market, except instead of only balancing supply and demand (to some extent) , it would also select for increasing efficiency, wages, and societal benefit.

# Mission

## Organizing an Outcome

Many a person I have spoken with in my own life, and many I find that see freedom where there is none, only pointing out the benevolent traits of the malevolent system, relying on their own confirmation bias to guide them forward on the endless path of conformity and servitude.

Why do such people only see good in the system that takes from them their futures, their humanity, and their freedom? Are they not aware of their rights, of their best interests, and of their morals?

Those that are aware of the societal state of affairs frequently take action in the form of protest, and I understand why people would go this route if the situation is desperate, or if they are uneducated, but why has such a route become the dominant approach in an educated society with plenty of time to be able to get coordinated and make further plans?

One does not fight the government to make positive change, one becomes the government. Their own government. That is what organizing is about. Organizing is not about causing chaos within the current order, organizing is about bringing about a fairer order.

It is not about destroying the prevailing order. It is about forming a new order that eclipses it. It is not about fighting power structures; it is about creating your own which surpass them.

The state has a monopoly on violence. Unless an organization has the means at hand to overwhelm the state’s monopoly on violence, and thus acquire the title of monopoly on violence for themselves, something which would take an immense quantity of resources to the point where it is essentially an unfeasible goal, there is not really a way to succeed on this route.

It will most certainly not work, in this case, for one to protest or to take militant action to achieve progress or go beyond the status quo, except through the political effect that a mass display of discontent has on the population, which itself is quite limited.

To go beyond the current system, one must create a system that is capable of doing what it does, and one which also has structural and organizational advantages over it. One can then use the weaknesses, accumulated within the current system over centuries, to consume it, taking in its constituents and resources alike.

Then from the old system’s remains can arise a much stronger, fairer system. That is how a peaceful revolution can take place. By acting, as a system, with diligence, honesty, responsibility, altruism, wisdom, fairness, social intelligence, proportionality, and respect for the lives of all, such a system can gain more power.

By gaining more credibility, authority, popularity, power, and relevance in the minds and hearts of the people, the new system can eclipse the authority of the old, which slowly dissolves as it becomes irrelevant and is replaced by a better order. An order which has earned the respect of the people after the old order lost their trust.

## Providing Power

To make mankind achieve the greatest level of power possible, we must move past the zero-sum approach, instead maximizing the potential of every single person in the world.

That would probably mean taking an approach to power that is quite the opposite of current approaches.

It would mean giving people more rights, opportunities, and things of significant human value like health care, drinking water, food, and social connections, all without being asked.

It means giving resources to people whose existence you were previously unaware of, and, on the flip side, getting resources from people whose existence you were previously unaware of, through mutually beneficial or at times altruistic transactions and investments.

In this, our goal isn't just to increase the power of individuals, but of humanity as a whole.

## Reinstating Relationship Reliability

We will always be dependent on others for our ongoing survival, but it is when malevolence, incompetence, and overall unreliability becomes a part of this relationship that problems occur.

It is not our dependence on people or systems that is the problem. It is our dependence on people or systems that are untrustworthy or unreliable.

If such systems do not exist which are reliable then it is our moral obligation to create new ones which are. This is for the benefit of all, because through the building of a new system, one frees people to live independently from the existing, unreliable systems. Everyone is better off with the presence of such an opportunity.

We know already that monopolies are bad for everyone who relies on them, but what happens when the entire economic and political system of an entire country maintains a power dynamic between itself and its citizens which is analogous to a monopoly?

Just as the owners of a monopoly will leverage their positions to benefit themselves, so too do those in the governmental and institutional positions which make up the dominant economic and political system.

This makes the system unreliable, untrustworthy, and ineffective at performing the roles it is supposed to perform, slowly guiding it on a more malevolent path. As such, it would be of the public interest that a new system be formed to provide an alternative to such an unreliable and untrustworthy system.

We do not, in our own life, allow someone we do not trust to play an important role in our lives. We would not willingly entrust our livelihood in the hands of someone who only has an interest in benefiting themselves. Why, then, should we entrust our collective livelihoods in a system that has proven time and time again to be unreliable and untrustworthy?

We shouldn’t. We should instead find or create a system that is reliable and trustworthy. Just as it is detrimental, as an individual, to have to depend on someone that cannot be trusted, so also is it detrimental to depend, as a collective, on a system which cannot be trusted.

We are all a part of the system we live within, even if we have little say in how it is run. What some may not consider, though, is that our organization determines the very nature of the system we live within.

We could, for example, contradict, subvert, and ultimately leverage the logic that the current system runs on, of our own will, and in doing so change it, and be much better off for taking such actions. It was through doing so, after all, which enabled the very first strikes, boycotts, and worker’s movements.

In our case, though, we need not even pursue such confrontational approaches when we can simply create our own systems, formed around our own social contracts to facilitate our own goals, where we set the terms and conditions. By doing so, we could bring about an alternative system - one which is actually capable of facilitating mutually beneficial relationships amongst ourselves and those around us, to the ultimate growth and further success of the movement we together amount to.

Relationship problems often occur among people when trust is not maintained, which result in tensions and disagreements. Those same problems can also occur between people and systems under similar circumstances.

People should have the option to cut ties in an abusive relationship with a system, and form new, healthier relationships with a different system.

They should not be forced to endure ongoing abuse for their entire working lives without being given another relationship option. There must be a second option, and we must enable it ourselves. Such is our moral imperative.

# Context

## From Inspiration to Initiative

I leveraged many of the insights I gained from an ambitious game mod project of mine, Stranded II Enhanced, when forming the ideas and frameworks which inspired this server. In Stranded II, I organized the folder for 3d model/texture/icon files for easier management early on, as my first task, splitting a large and cluttered pile of resources into an organized structure of associated file groups according to the same naming scheme present in the system files, so I could locate 3D models, textures, and icons according to their corresponding category.

I then proceeded to integrate parts of a different mod, Stranded 2.5, into the game files. Stranded 2.5 had far better 3d models than the original for many objects and entities in the game, but was in German, and lacked specific functionalities present in the original game for no evident reason. As such, I replaced many of the existing 3d models in my mod with 3d models from this mod, the end result being better graphics without compromise.

I then took my mod and integrated it into the platforms of other mods, which had different source code revisions of the actual game file itself, which took a while but was ultimately successful. I created the lite and the + version of my mod, the lite version having no additional stuff added to it, just improved graphics and general enhancement. The + version of it, however, I didn't hold back on.

I went through existing mods one by one, incorporating anything with enough quality to meet my standards into my mod, and leaving the scraps and defects behind. I did this until the point at which there were no mods left to take stuff from, having gone through a few dozen of them, and during this process I also improved many of the 3d models and scripts for various things in the game, and turned various poorly functioning, conceptual systems into well-functioning features of the game, completing the old dreams of abandoned projects.

And then, I learned how to compile the source code, and things intensified. I took the source code for s2boost, a version that ran faster and fixed a problem with the game textures turning black, and the source code for stranded II multiplayer, which added multiplayer functionality. I merged them with WinMerge, one section at a time, and miraculously, despite literally being a code Frankenstein of the two, it ran without a single error on the first run.

If you haven't figured out the reason behind the name I use, it shouldn't be hard to now.

By this time, I had developed a proficiency for integrating systems, even conflicting and seemingly incompatible ones. I had developed an appreciation for just what can be created when one has ambition, a large pool of free resources, and a bit of free time on their hands. Importantly, I expanded my imagination, conjuring creative concepts and subsequently implementing them. I began to think, I began to perceive, I began to feel reward, through the lens of systems.

I became interested in physics at some point, jumping from model to model, from framework to framework, learning and forming associations, observing patterns, experiencing intense moments of epiphany, and, at some point in time, formalizing my internalized framework of physics. Then I showed it to some people and received a weak response. I began questioning the value in my idea, realizing that, even if entirely accurate, my model would still improve little on the refined methods already in use.

And then I asked myself a question.

Knowing my own intellectual capacity, what area should I seek to develop, in order to make the most of my abilities in achieving a positive impact?

I settled on economics.

I created the early layout of a system, which I showed on an online forum, and to some acquaintances of mine. One of them told me I should write a book.
It sounded like a good way to get more of my ideas down, without having to cut everything out. 
So I did. I wrote over 120 pages of works, and created a discord server to collaborate on them and improve them with others, with the realization that I could more effectively actualize my aspirations online, with far less resources, more connectivity, and easier expansion, to fully formulate the ideological foundation of the movement, and bring awareness to it in the process. 

It took to the point where I had already built a discord server around it and accumulated over 200 members before realizing that a book was not really the goal I had in mind, due to various reasons. I had already planned on making it free to distribute anyway, and I came to realize that it was insanely inefficient for others to get value out of the works in book format, so I took the book and split it into segments, and created a new server, purpose-built to contain them and the works of others. I took all of the individual segments from the book, refined them, and posted them separately so they could be more easily accessed, organized, searched, and maintained.

It was not long before I realized this also was not enough. We needed a platform that would properly allow versioning, structuring, and merging of ideological frameworks, and this is where github came to mind.

So that is what we used.

## Surmounting Systemic Cynicism

Allow me to introduce you to some revelations of mine, which provided me with insight and inspiration that was instrumental to the formation of the All or Everything movement...

As humans, we're most interested in ourselves.

I decided long ago that I was going to dedicate my time and effort towards achieving societal goals. Rather than working my days away at a job, I poured my time and effort into a movement. People saw my approach as backwards. I should be spending my time chasing a career, working 9-5, or going to college, before pursuing such passions, right?

Wrong. This is the correct approach. It only appears backwards coming from the perspective of the majority of a society reliant on a backwards approach. These things, they are what everyone else is doing. Pursuing individual interests, disconnected from the system within which they are pursued, as overall conditions continuously worsen.

Very few people are dedicating their time and effort towards creating and implementing effective solutions to global and systemic issues plaguing humanity and diminishing our prospects worldwide, both individually and collectively.

As humans, we see things on an individual level, guided by individual interests, finding little interest in pursuing things outside of the individual level. Humanity exists on the global level, as an interconnected collection of individuals, the majority of whom hold little interest or perspective outside themselves and their own day-to-day lives.

So, I can spend my time working within this system, or I can spend my time forming frameworks and gathering people together into an effective and interconnected movement, where we can bring about an entirely new system which runs more efficiently and solves the problems of the current system.

We do not go about solving our problems using the same thinking that created our problems.

# Ideals

## Alignment of Interests

The goal of All or Everything is to align the interests of all actors with the betterment of conditions for the public. It is thus a prerequisite that our own interests are aligned with the betterment of conditions for the public from the very onset.

## Consequential Responsibility and Ideological Indifference

Ideas are to be primarily judged according to their outcomes, with a open-minded, analytical, and centrist style of approach based on the grounded consideration of all the significant factors at hand.

It is recommended that all individuals remain impartial and do their best to avoid harboring ideological affections beyond the extent that is justified by grounded analysis.

Our focus is to be directed towards the specific approaches, mentalities, and frameworks, among other things, found within various ideological movements.

The actual form that something takes is far more critical than the label it is provided, and we plan to investigate the usefulness of specific approaches and frameworks from many different systems and ideological movements on a case-by-case basis.

After this, we may integrate them into our own system if they show potential to be useful, selectively appropriating (while giving credit) the most valuable ideas we find, so as to complement our concepts and frameworks while leaving behind everything found to be unsuitable.

## Consistent Commitment

Our movement should be consistent in its goals, views, and ideals, changing only for the purpose of further improving upon them.

It should maintain honesty and integrity and live up to the image it presents of itself.

There should be no changes to these goals, views, or ideals for the sake of pandering or appealing to more people. It will not be the movement desperately trying to gain members like door-to-door Jehovah’s Witness missionaries.

Instead, people should want to join because of the merit of the movement itself. A movement that stays true to its values will earn respect from those that matter the most.

A movement should appeal especially to those with solid morals and values, as those are the type who present the most value.

This is most critical early on, when the culture is still being shaped, so that good values are promoted and perpetuated from the onset, providing an example for members that come after.

This will serve to make the movement itself healthier and more cohesive by enabling and supporting behavior that improves collaboration and constructive conduct among members, while also strengthening the moral integrity of the movement itself, preventing corruption within it.

Such is to be preferred in a movement that seeks to achieve the goals it sets out to accomplish.

## Considering Crime

A movement should also not engage in crimes, lest they be seen as criminals, though crimes of moral benefit to others or absolute necessity may, potentially, be overlooked, depending on the context. Crime should obviously never become a standard mode of operation in any case so long as just and ethical action remains legal.

## Ethical Economics

It is important to be aware of what specifically a given person can trust an economy to do, and how that affects their behavior and mindset, subsequently guiding their approaches, decisions, and actions within it.

For starters, there are some things that one should, for all practical purposes, not be able to trust within a given economy. One should not be able to trust in unethical business practices to achieve gains in an ideal economy.

Fraud, scamming, financial crime, and crime in general should not be viable pursuits to be trusted or relied on for financial gain, as they sabotage and undermine the system within which they take place.

Instead, one should be able to trust in or rely on a business practice to bring them gains if and only if it is ethical and adds value to the economy, with gains ideally being proportional to the net value one brings forth, ensuring that all economic activity is mutually reinforcing to the health of both the economy and those that exist within it.

Such is the logical next step in the evolution of human economic organization, as no sufficiently advanced system should willingly bring about its own parasites to feed upon it.

## Neutral by Name, Neutral by Nature

Our movement should make due consideration that it avoids identifying itself using specific economic ideologies.

Instead, it should identify itself by its relative absence of adherence to specific economic ideologies.

This will provide a greater amount of creative freedom, and a shift away from complacency. Instead of arguing about whether ideas fit within a given label or perspective, we can instead focus on their effectiveness first and foremost.

Sometimes the answers lie outside of our own perspective. That is why intellectual diversity is valuable, so long as discussions are approached with genuine interest in understanding each other's perspectives.

## Standards Shaping Success

Collaboration, trust, shared standards, mutual benefit, wisdom, adaptability, and a culture of problem solving and innovation are the qualities of a movement that is fit to succeed in their aims.

Such a movement will be able to work within the existing system with ease, shaping its surroundings as it sees fit.

It can act, to a great extent, as a single collective, evolving entity, achieving the betterment of public conditions by leveraging all advantages it has available.

## Cultivating Community

It takes a village to raise a child.

This means that one’s parents are not fully adequate to shape the trajectory of one’s future alone, that others should be present to assist in this endeavor, and that children should thus be given a network of social opportunities and support figures at a young age.

Each child requires significant investment, and should be given priority by the government and schooling system, in both investment and consideration, for the best outcome.

This is in stark contrast to the current systems, which puts very little funding or consideration into children, while also coercing and manipulating kids into taking a future path they would not themselves take of their own volition.

## Rethinking Retribution

Our current legal system is guided by the trajectory of history, and the trajectory of history is rarely guided by rational logic, but instead by circumstance, opinion, and the examples set in previous eras.

Let’s take a step outside of that process, approaching the subject with pragmatic and rational creativity.

We can start by asking the following question: what happens if we take the phrase “love the sinner, hate the sin” and apply it to crime as well?

When considering crime, the question is then not how much one should punish murderers, rapists, thieves, and scammers, but how one can reduce the rates of murder, rape, theft, and fraud.

It should also be considered how solace can be brought to the victims of such crimes, should they occur, along with those impacted by the crimes indirectly.

If punishment happens to reduce the rates of such crimes, such a method can be pursued to the extent that the reduction in crime justifies the application or increase of punishment, but should under no circumstance be increased upon reaching diminishing returns in those regards.

In any case, punishment should not be the primary mode of achieving the goal of crime reduction, as its very mechanism of action relies on human suffering and fear to achieve those objectives. Fortunately, other methods are plentiful.

## Representing Reality

A movement should not simply announce its goals by delivering obscure populist messaging to the masses.

Instead, it should build its goals, strategically laying out the groundwork to build a better future.

Only when it has finished should it announce the goals, plan, and likely outcomes, and it should do so concisely to the public.

In that way, the public will be aware not just of the goals, but also the ways in which they plan to achieve them, as well as the likely outcomes achieving them would have.

This way, people will know that this movement not only stands for what it says, but also has viable plans to achieve its stated goals, which will have good outcomes.

In other words, the phrase “fake it till you make it” should not be used as the guiding slogan.

The movement should first make their plans, then display their plans for the public to judge on their merits.

A movement should not act like the contemporary corporation or organization with playful messaging. Instead it should convey competence, confidence, inspiration, courage, and coherence.

It is a movement that exists in the present, not in the fantasy world of cringy public relations propaganda.

It should be comforting to those within, appealing to those outside, and intimidating to those who are unsure, such that they would rather be with it than against it, due to the competence it conveys itself with.

It should be something people want to side with, by natural inclination.

Likewise, it should make itself immune to unjustified opposition, and difficult to target or scapegoat due to the very nature of how it interacts with the public, and the nature of how it allocates information.

In doing so, a movement can inform, grow, retain, compel, and defend, a strategy upon which success may be built.

## Proof in Presentation

Above all, the movement should build soft power to achieve its aims.

It should be able to honestly portray itself, and be supported for what it is, and what it stands for.

It should be truly dedicated to helping those around it, and be supported for that reason, and it should, within its abilities, prove its worth by improving the lives of those affected by it.

In doing so, it will improve its image and, more importantly, people’s lives.

## Tactics of Transformation

Now, how does a movement bring about change, exactly?

Well, first we must look at the manner in which we operate to achieve such ends to begin with.

We should operate at the speeds in which we perform at our best, neither rushing nor lingering.

We should also seek effective, sophisticated, non-divisive, and non-disruptive methods of achieving our ends, forming a well-organized social structure as a movement.

This movement should have, and maintain, mutual trust in one another, and adopt a code of ethics promoting fairness, honesty, responsibility, and mutual respect among members.

This movement should act, collectively, in a manner that is wise, and benevolent to those within and outside of it.

This has benefits in many ways. First, it is helpful by ensuring that publicly detrimental means are not used by the movement, and thus that it does not develop a dangerous mindset in which all means are justified by the ends.

It also serves to bolster a movement’s public image, and helps to gain trust, which itself is critical to bring in members and gain public support and approval.

Now, acting wisely means picking battles wisely. Ideally there would be no conflicts that we would have to engage in, for, as Sun Zhu would have you know, the most successful wars are those won without either side firing a single shot.

While many successful battles in the public arena may require a shot or two, these should always be kept at minimum, thus reducing risk.

As such, drama or overt disagreement against outside entities or individuals should be kept to a minimum, and when a statement must be made against someone or something, it should be crafted with skill and delivered through the proper medium to the right people according to the situation.

## Considering Contribution

One should be able to trust an economic system to reward them for contributing, and one should not be able to rely on the system to reward them for hindering it. If one is not rewarded for contributing, one will not contribute.

Thus, every way in which one can contribute should also be paired with a mechanism that rewards one according to one’s contribution, in order to maximize the ease with which rewarding contributions can be made, and thus the overall amount of contributions made.

The more contribution methods an economic system enables and rewards, the more likely it is that people will contribute to it, as it is more convenient. The more appropriately and consistently a system rewards these contributions, the higher the likelihood there is that people will continue contributing, as they will hold more trust for it.

If people are awarded proportionally to their contribution, it will not take them long to discover the most effective methods of contribution, whatever those happen to be. In doing so, they set a precedent, and an example, for people who are following the money, who will do as they do.

This results in much higher productivity, as methods to more productively contribute to the system are discovered and replicated among people.

For the sake of all things economic, a system should develop as many avenues of trust, collaboration, and mutual cooperation and benefit as it is capable of, so as to maximize the convenience and reliability it presents for those it interacts with on a regular basis, and thus to maximize the amount people are willing to contribute to it, and, subsequently, the amount it is able to provide them in return.

## Proposing Possibilities

While it is true that the system itself may be beyond redemption, the same is not to be said for the largest beneficiaries of it.

At the end of the day, we’re all in this together, and it is a fool’s errand to try to solve the world’s problems alone.

Remember that the rich are not free of good intentions or altruism, as they are people like the rest of us, just with more money and influence. Remember also that they live within the limitations of their own perspective, though only if they aren’t introduced to that of others.

Without telling someone what the problem is, they will never be able to be a part of the solution. It’s only fair, if we are to condemn them for their lack of action, that we at least let them know of the possibility beforehand.

## Effectiveness in Engagement

Change via public protest is relatively unproductive when fighting for positive change of this nature, and there are several reasons for that.

Protests tend to be short-lived, lacking clear aims while being socially disruptive and thus divisive, and failing to have a direct effect on policy, instead relying solely on public pressure to sway the decisions of politicians.

The controversy and risk surrounding public protests turns away potential supporters, and when it does work, there is little guaranteed that it will work beyond the short term, because it does not replace the politicians.

It also, at the end of the day, still relies on the same politicians for it to work in the first place, which is not ideal.

Different approaches can be far more practical, achieving more with less effort while also being less disruptive to society. It is these different approaches that we should explore.

## A Founding Foundation

Plans may differ, strategies may improve, and the complexities of reality may favor various specific approaches, but the general truth remains.

For the most important and fundamental types of change to come about most effectively, strategic and well-planned actions must be taken. Things must be coordinated. Rules must be made. Foresight must be utilized. Goals must be established.

The very first thing a movement must do is to formulate its ideological, operational, and strategic approach, laying out a solid information foundation that, once established, can be used as the basis for the many following decisions that must be made.

A foundation of formalized systems, rigorously formulated and infused with valuable insights, without which we will find ourselves subject only to opinion as the basis of all action, must be procured, established, and brought into action, enabling an order which far surpasses the existing state of affairs and enables the advancement of humanity far beyond that which could ever be achieved in the existing system.

# Paradigm

## Accepting All Approaches

When it comes to economics, and to economic thought, it is important not to exclude different approaches to the economy, lest valuable ideas and perspectives be discarded. Not all the best ideas will lie within one school of thought or another, but rather they tend to be dispersed among them.

Even bad or failed ideas will generally be built upon some aspect of truth, and with some underlying wisdom. These can serve as inspiration for much better and more advanced ideas.

Also, since the economic, social, and political landscape within which an idea is conceived can vary greatly, it provides a wide array of different perspectives, goals, and concepts regarding the economy. These are valuable when considering the many challenges facing any given economic system.

New ideas emerge when old ideas converge. Why can’t we have people like Socialists and Anarcho-Capitalists working together on a project? Sure, they’ll disagree on things. This is to be expected. 

Standards of good faith can be formed, and people can reconcile their differences peacefully and without excessive casualties. This can serve to bring people out of the confinement of their own ideological views and into the world of direct application, where feasibility, practicality, and accuracy are placed above ideology.

One must consider all systems and ideas presented, and take their own creative liberties as needed when forming a system which is to be adequate in serving its purpose according to the requirements posed by the natural world.

This includes Capitalism, Socialism, Communism, Feudalism, Mercantilism, Anarchism, Mutualism, Corporatism, Keynesianism/Post-Keynesianism, Technocracy, Agrarianism, Distributism, Resource-Based Economics, De-growth Economics, and more.

When ideas or perspectives are left out, and not allowed to be taken into consideration as part of the process of creating ideas or making plans, any value within those ideas get thrown by the wayside. Doing such is a waste of ideas, and any value they hold will then never make it into the end result, rendering the end result less valuable.

And, even if no direct value can be found within an economic system, it still has the potential to offer more insights or ideas regarding how to construct a good framework. If it can’t do that, it can at least serve as an example of what not to do.

One must consider all systems and ideas presented. Many ideas bring new insight to the table despite their flaws, and often we have misconceptions about them to begin with.

Movements can either compete with each other for members, or they can join together and share and compare notes. They can either remain stuck in their current position, making little progress against their well-coordinated and battle-proven adversaries who remain comfortably at the top, or they can set aside their differences and accept help from each other.

Among ideals and ends, there is currently no silver bullet to cure all of our problems, but if we put our ideas together, compare them, accept their flaws, and integrate together the best available solutions within each of them into a cohesive economic system, we will be able to come much closer to, or possibly reach, this illusive silver bullet we seek.

During this process, several important things will happen. First, all concepts will have to be compared and deeply considered by people coming from multiple perspectives and taking multiple angles of approach. If a concept, upon review, is found too flawed to be of use, this must be sufficiently demonstrated to, and recognized by, all involved. It can then be picked apart, to salvage any valuable insights, methods, or frameworks found within, before being discarded.

In this way, the least accurate or most harmful ideas within many different ideological frameworks can be filtered out. Using what remains, a more effective and higher quality framework can be formed by incorporating what remains. During this process it is likely that entirely new ideas would emerge as well, perhaps ones which function even better than all of those which have been considered in previous frameworks.
With a more unified movement, with a more practical and capable ideological framework, with more extensive strategy, planning, and coordination, the chances of actually achieving things increases dramatically.

## Awareness of Awareness

Without taking the time to understand the understanding of others, one lacks the ability to start out from their perspective when paving the path towards truth.

A path which is built too great a distance away from the travelers it seeks to accommodate will be scarcely used, and thus so too will the truth.

Thus, it is better to start at the same point as the travelers, and, from that point, lead to the truth, rather than to begin an exchange starting from one's own perception, confusing and alienating one's audience with unfamiliarity.

## Compounding Approaches

To leverage our ability to the maximum, it is recommended to utilize, and to synthesize, a plethora of mutually reinforcing tactics.

What this may add in complexity, it will also add in effectiveness. The general goal here is to reach a critical mass of compounding and mutually reinforcing approaches at which point success is virtually guaranteed.

This implies a heavy emphasis on a multidisciplinary approach, and a focus on effective systems integration.

## Full Contribution Acknowledgment

For each contribution, the original poster will be given full recognition for their contribution.

It is recommended to also mention those which have inspired one's own works.

# Concepts

## Economic Escalation

Capitalism scales poorly. It works on the small scale quite well, and it is a great way of keeping track of favors and debt, specifically on the small scale.

On the small scale it works as a convenient, self-regulating system with few problems. However, when we start adding size and complexity bad things happen.

Every minor tendency of the system starts to compound, and various quirks of the system start to reproduce themselves and are amplified.

Inequality happens, fraud happens, pyramid schemes sprout up, and the system itself slowly evolves into a very efficient system of exploitation.

The most successful boost their way to the top in the Capitalist framework by using clever strategies to accumulate as much financial gain with as little effort as possible.

In other words, exploitation, given that the way this is facilitated is by appropriating, or essentially taking credit for, the work of others.

The more workers one is able to appropriate work from, and the more work one is able to appropriate per worker, the more successful one becomes.

The only limits to this are the number of workers one is able to employ, the minimum wage said workers are willing to work for, and the amount of work which one is able to convert into a given type of product before the sheer volume of that type of product is so vast that it leads to diminishing returns, due to customers being no longer willing to pay as much for a product which they already have enough of.

Once those which excel at exploiting these variables reach the top, they continue their ways, but at an even bigger scale.

Others see their success and follow suit, employing the same strategies, in attempts to emulate the success of those at the top. This mentality spreads throughout the general economy, with society suffering the consequences of this economic arms race.

In such circumstances, competition is placed above all else, including the health and welfare of the workers, the customers, and society as a whole.

This is what creates the conditions under which the necessity arises for worker’s rights movements and unions, for customer protection laws, and for CSR and ESG measures. 

Altogether, however, such developments are not nearly enough to sufficiently address the issues which run rampant in the system.

The problems are simply too immense, and our recognition of them too infrequent, to bring about the necessary conditions for the formation and implementation of solutions to the dysfunction in the current economic system.

The resulting conditions alone won't bring about solutions. They don't need to though.

That is a task for us to achieve.

## Electoral Exploitation

The current method of governance, representative democracy via voting, has fundamental flaws which cannot be fully reconciled.

The problem with a state-sanctioned popularity contest is that it is exclusionary by nature, as popularity is easier to maintain than it is to increase, while also being highly correlated with the power one possesses and subject to the fickle nature of human perception.

The contest itself can also be easily exploited by those willing to mislead large segments of the public.

Not only do these facts make the contest itself unfair and skewed towards the rich and powerful, but they also result in a significantly detrimental impact on the population and their collective perception of the state of reality itself.

It tends to overemphasize one’s image over one’s actions, leading to the persistent state of hyperreality that is pervasive within politics.

## Evolution through Natural Direction

Evolution is a game of statistical strategy on all levels, and it is based on a simple logic which is as follows: Things which are stable in some form remain in that form. Patterns in the physical world which reproduce themselves more quickly than they are destroyed will multiply until they entirely saturate the material medium they exist within.

These patterns are what we refer to as life. We know that patterns which are destroyed before reproducing themselves do not repeat, instead ceasing to exist entirely, and that this acts, in effect, as a spontaneously emergent negative reinforcement mechanism by removing all patterns which do not repeat.

Meanwhile, for those that do repeat, any acquired deviation(s) enabling a given pattern to more effectively reproduce itself within its material medium will become more prevalent, which provides what is, in effect, a spontaneously emergent positive reinforcement mechanism, reinforcing any random deviations which increase their own proliferation.

The negative reinforcement mechanism notably is the one in play when patterns are out-competed for resources by other patterns which have grown more capable in response to the positive reinforcement mechanism, and also when organisms grow and reproduce without restraint, and then have massive die-offs.

Now, organisms game this system quite well, as DNA tends to be optimized so that mutations primarily occur in regions where mutations are low-risk and high-benefit, and very rarely appear on the more critical and sensitive sections. Thus, the organism is able to gain the most benefit it can from each mutation that does happen. Statistical optimization in a nutshell.

This itself is demonstrative of another thing, a premise which is instrumental to understanding evolution in completeness, and it is that the form a pattern exists as to begin with determines which deviations are likely to emerge, which determines what it is capable of evolving in the future, which shapes the trajectory of its continuous evolution.

The trajectory of evolution is naturally shaped by the system it manifests within. It is random, and it is predictable. It is a trend, and our bloodline is the trendsetter.

It's also important to keep in mind that the positive and negative reinforcement mechanisms are individual by nature, and do not naturally account for collective evolution, and are therefore unstable to a significant extent.

In human society, those which are able to gain the greatest advantage over the rest of society are positively reinforced, while those which are the most disadvantaged are negatively reinforced. This creates a dynamic ripe for exploitation and oppression, which results in a frequently observed tendency of humans towards societal regression as a whole.

It is this dynamic which is responsible for the recurring emergence of economically and politically backwards societies with authoritarian structures of power, exploitative economic relations, and neglect and mistreatment for the most vulnerable. It is this which explains the tendency of successful individuals to kick away the ladder to success once they have climbed it.

It is this dynamic which, above all other things, must be obstructed, undermined, and at some point eliminated in any society which seeks to achieve progress for humanity.
‎
However, a tendency to take advantage of this positive reinforcement mechanism is, by this point, hard-coded into our behavior through millions of years of genetic optimization, so there must be a productive outlet for it, given that it is intrinsic to human behavior, or people will do more destructive things as a result of this tendency.

Societally beneficial behavior should be provided as an option to seek advantage, and as the only type of behavior which would reliably and substantially provide such advantage. In such a scenario, it would then be the case that the only behavior which is a benefit to oneself is also a benefit to society.

Organized civilization is an attempt, by humans, to form a body of human scale, through their collective organization, to be able to afford the advantages that such an arrangement provides.

However, any body which humanity has formed has never sufficiently adapted to the point where it can prevent the emergence of the human-scale analog to cancer, which is exploitation.

It is brought on by those who engage in predatory and parasitic behaviors with others in society to gain an advantage over them, and time and time again it is this which has led to the downfall of societies.

The reason that many societies fall into a stable relationship whereby those who exploit emerge and remain at the top, however, is due to the fact that, in a non-exploitative and fairly equal society, there is not nearly as much direct motive for individuals to prevent exploitative behaviors as there is for individuals to partake in these behaviors, and those that partake in these behaviors become ever more skilled at it, establishing systems of power when they come against resistance and find the need to enforce their exploitation.
‎
The underlying factor behind the creation, the modification, and the destruction of all civilizations is direct human motivation and the subsequent behavior resulting from it, and if there currently exists no motive in maintaining the current order, or insufficient organization or competence among those that do hold a motive in maintaining the current order, then the current order does not last for long, and within it a new order overwrites it.

## Operating on Opinion

People have positive inbuilt associations with themselves, and with people who they perceive to be similar to them, or supporting their perspective. They have these associations as a mechanism through which they shape their social surroundings in a way which facilitates and manifests their perspectives, to their own benefit.

This mechanism works by forming tight-knit circles of like-minded individuals. These alliances strengthen their beliefs while oftentimes undermining, excluding, and/or suppressing differing and especially conflicting perspectives. As common viewpoints gain traction within these circles, they shape societal norms, sidelining alternative perspectives.

Interacting with those who share similar views amplifies one's influence, allowing them to push their agendas further. This dynamic is a crucial aspect of societal dynamics, where shared beliefs determine the prevailing order.

Surrounding oneself with like-minded individuals isn't done merely to find comfort—it's done to form power and mold society to one's liking. This is why it is so much easier to work and socialize with people of similar perspectives.

At the end of the day, working with like-minded people is what enables one to establish their perspective over the whole of society, to their own benefit. It is a function of political power, and the manifestation of our own will.

## Deconstructing Dimensions

Our brain perceives the world in 2D, in the sense that the light sensor in our eyes captures information using a 2D hexagonal grid.

It is only subsequent processing by our brain which renders what we see as 3D, and since this processing occurs within our minds and not externally, and because the processing pipeline uses a 2D sensor to extrapolate a 3D environment, we can also see depictions on 2D surfaces as 3D, if they are drawn to appear as such.

This is because our visual processing centers specialize in taking 2D images and using them to create 3D representations, and it is deeply ingrained in our perception.

The only reason we consider the world to be 3D anyway is due to the fact that a position in space within the natural world requires at least three dimensions (i.e. values) to accurately map its location due to basic features of geometry. That's it.

There is no settled universal orientation in which these three dimensions are to be angled, and they can be rotated in any direction while still just as accurately mapping locations of things in the natural world.

In that sense, 3D is simply a coordinate system that is used to record and store location information using a simple but powerful mathematical framework.

The math is based off of reality, but we should not mistake the math for reality itself. The world is not 3D, in the sense that it is not the math that describes it.

The fact of the matter is that we're entirely dependent on frameworks that were invented in the ancient past to orient any semblance of a consistent description of the natural world.

## Function Analysis

To determine what a given entity is capable of, and to predict its future behavior, one can analyze it by reducing it to the functions it possesses.

This can provide useful insight on multiple fonts.

It can help to make it more obvious which functions the movement lacks, so they can be introduced.

It can make it clear how the opposition operates, and how the movement can change its own functionality to best adapt to and take advantage of this.

It can also be used to find out whether an individual is set up to fail or succeed in a given scenario, and why.

## Interactions in Interfaces

How systems interact with each other depends on their interface. As complex biological systems of collectivistic cells, we are no exception. We have an interface so obvious it's right under our nose, and on the tip of our tongue, because this interface is the face.

Through this we convey the state of our internal emotions, we communicate with others, and we take in information from the world around us. This interface is fundamental to shaping the nature of human interaction, but it is only one among many that shapes how the modern world as we know it behaves.

Consider the screen that you're reading this on, and how fundamental its invention was to much of how society interacts and communicates today. Without such interfaces, society would not be able to exist. As it is, interfaces very directly shape the nature that society does exist in, by facilitating the many functions it carries out.

All in all, interfaces shape outcomes, so pay attention to how you're interacting, and consider coming up with your own innovations in interfaces to help shape what starts in this server into a success story.

## Countering Complacency

The economy as it stands cannot simply lean on natural selection to brute force improvement independent of the policies or provision in place, no matter how much free-market enthusiasts may proclaim.

The economy won't automatically improve simply due to natural selection, and it shouldn't be applied to the economy without proper understanding and consideration.

Natural selection kills. That fact is fundamental to how it operates. It brings forth death to all that aren't sufficiently prepared for the conditions they're exposed to.

The economy sets these conditions, and as such, the economy should be designed to create preferable conditions for the people within it. People should not have to "evolve" (i.e. get good or die) within it, and anyone who says as much is cold, heartless, and deeply misguided in their approach.

Justifying injustice and rationalizing irrationality in such a way only serves to distort the picture and veil the actual problems, leading to an economy that is worse for those inside of it in every measurable aspect.

## Education Exposed

Consider, why is it that in modern days, children are put into boring classrooms for extended periods of time where they are forced to do arbitrary tasks for their superiors without any say in how they are treated? Are we being conditioned to accept the common workplace subjugation experience? Are we being turned into disposable task monkeys with no goals beyond basic survival? This is the very definition of infantilization.

Such treatment also isn’t very helpful given that spending so much time inside without any significant physical activity has been proven to stunt overall development, that conformity within current schools is given significant precedence over autonomy, and that the whole system is built in a way that takes advantage of students’ fear of missing out, as well as their worries of their future, while generally monopolizing access to their sphere of friendships and social relationships, all for the purpose of ensuring continued enrollment and to motivate students - unethically.

This gives students little to no direct benefits, but a significant amount of extra anxiety, stress, and pressure, all of which tend to reduce their ability to learn, their self-confidence, and their opinion of school and learning in general. It does not take a genius to realize why so many kids hate school, but here I am anyway. You’re welcome.

## Calibrating Currency

Many times it has been proposed to base economic value off of a single substance to increase the stability of money. This has been done throughout history at least since gold was used as the main metric of value, though recently there has been similar such proposals, such as the idea that economic value could be based off of energy, specifically electricity.

Now, seeing this proposal brought a feeling of déjà vu, for it was an idea I myself had pondered long ago. This idea, though it seemed good at the time, is, in retrospect, misguided. Why? Because electricity, gold, and any other practical or material goods are subject to supply and demand themselves, they are too volatile to be suitable for the purpose of balancing a currency, which is supposed to be the mediator of supply and demand.

Rather than that, then, we can instead rely on a “diversified portfolio” of different practical and material goods. However, at that point one can simply rely on the market, as that is essentially what it is, in aggregate.

So, back to square one. We cannot use a single material good as a base for the value of currency. However, there is also another problem.

The free market itself also does a poor job at providing an adequate representation of value, and is full of distortions. Why is this? Let’s dive into the list of reasons:

First off, people understand money and prices subjectively. They cannot directly know the production unit cost or research and development costs of a product or service without research into it. Whether a price seems large or small is subject to context and perception.

People cannot directly assess the value of a product or service, so they use context, perceptions, assumptions, and preexisting conceptualizations of value to make guesses.

These guesses will rarely match the actual value of, or even cost to produce, the end product if they are not given knowledge of the actual value to begin with.

This irrationality can be exacerbated by the plethora of marketing techniques in use today, as well as price manipulation. Human psychology is not perfectly rational; people will always take some things for granted, while overvaluing other things. The amount they are willing to pay for something, then, will not mirror the true value of that thing, and will not serve to provide fair compensation for the value it holds, or to fairly offset the production cost of it.

Let’s propose a solution. If we cannot rely on the customers themselves to accurately determine the value of a product, we can have the value of products systematically calculated using various methods of more accurately estimating the value they provide their customers and the larger society.

We can use a few different variables to determine what the end value of the product would be, like average time saved per day per customer, productivity amplifier effects, health impact on customers, how vital it is for people’s daily functioning, ease of reuse or recycling, effects of externalities, longevity and quality, product specifications, and any other relevant properties that have practical economic, individual, and societal implications.

When the unit value is calculated, it can be displayed in the store next to the product as a benchmark, alongside the unit price, to allow customers to more accurately and more easily assess the value of the product.

Both the production unit cost and unit value of a given product could be added together to determine the set price of that given product. The calculations performed using those metrics should, of course, be geared towards reaching the optimal price, in order for a given product to have the best effect on society and the economy.
Note that the production unit cost would be simply to allow the producer to break even, and the unit value would be what decides how much money the producer would earn for each product after costs are accounted for, thus directing economic activities, via incentives, towards the benefit of the purchaser and the surrounding society.

Extra or insufficient supply or demand would require the raising or lowering of prices temporarily, and could be accounted for by the same entity that is to be tasked with calculating the prices to begin with. This entity, when lowering prices below that which the producer was promised to be paid due to low demand or high supply, would use the surplus money generated in areas where prices are raised above the contracted price due to high demand or low supply to pay for the discrepancy.

Such an entity would, of course, be balanced towards gaining more money overall, and would store extra money in reserves so that it is prepared for temporary losses.

This feature would have the advantage of maintaining stable sale prices and profits for producers, increasing their financial stability and thus that of their workers, their suppliers, their leader(s), and thus the overall economy itself.

The other features would serve to reduce price exploitation and prevent value miscalculation for customers. Instead of perceived quality, customers would be able to be aware of the actual calculated value of the product, and as current trends would suggest, they would be willing to pay more for things of higher value, so the higher price would not drive down sales, but would likely do the opposite, as it would serve as an indicator of value.
Of course, different amounts of value can be obtained from a given product for different people. This, too, can be calculated and displayed, showing different values a product would have for different people.

While actually factoring these different values into the price would cause inconsistencies and price inequalities, which could also be exploited by secondhand sellers, displaying them would at least give various different people, like parents, construction workers, teachers, and engineers, among others, a general idea of how much value products would provide for them specifically according to their occupation or role in society, and as a side effect make people more aware of the fact that products will.

This would make people more likely to buy products that would benefit them the most based on their occupation or situation.

These methods would strike a balance between the forces of supply and demand and the benefits of prescriptive pricing, which consist of better market stability, more consistency, higher efficiency, and overall simplicity. They would display the variables behind the pricing of products, improving market transparency, and would ensure that people truly do get what they pay for to a significant extent, increasing overall customer satisfaction.

Such solutions would make it easier for producers, customers, and the economy to thrive. After all, life is much better when everyone is able to benefit, and true value is rewarded for being created.

## Autonomy Appropriated

Far too often the method used to obtain power is to take the power from other people, even though converting other people’s power into one’s own is inefficient. This is primarily because the holder is the main bottleneck when it comes to utilizing the power that they have.

By taking the natural power, which is the power inherent in all people, away from others, it strips them of the ability to guide the usage of their power using their own intelligence, which is designed specifically to guide the usage of their power.

Instead, the usage of their power becomes determined by a proxy, who can exercise that power regardless of the subsequent consequences it has on the true source of it. This is the wrong way to do things. It is also fundamentally against the idea of autonomy or self-determination.

People are designed, from nerves and muscles to senses and cognitive functions, to use their own power to their own benefit. Much of the brain’s functionality exists for that very purpose. It exists in order to grant people the ability to effectively use their own power themselves, among other things, and it is very effective for that purpose primarily on an individual scale.

Because of this, the people that take power away from others remove much more overall power, which manifests collectively, than the power they gain, as an individual, in doing so. It is a very inefficient conversion process. Power that is taken from others will inevitably be poorly utilized. It seems to quite often be the case, since it is not truly their power, that the thief of power often takes it for granted. That they tend to use it however they please, without much regard to the efficacy of its use, or who the beneficiaries of that power are.

## Inverting Influence

Not a single person can choose where they are born, who their parents are, or what their future life will be. Even our processes for rational thought and decision making are shaped by our upbringing. As the poor are, so are the rich.

We are all, fundamentally, the product of our environment’s influence on us. It may be, perhaps, that problems arise when one’s environment hasn’t interacted properly with oneself.

Perhaps these problems become more common when parts of one’s environment, specifically other people, assume one must do things which said environment has not prompted one to do. Perhaps it is assumed that one must achieve success. Maybe it is assumed that one must give back to society. At the end of the day, their environment is the main decider of whether or not those ends are pursued, or realized.

Because of this, in can be deduced that many are born into this world with unrealistic or unfair expectations, considering their environment. On the plus side, though, this indicates that, by playing an outsize role in the environment of rich and powerful individuals, one may be able to influence them, and thus their future actions, for good.

It has been observed throughout history that the rich have been able to significantly influence the poor, but what may be less well-known is that this works in reverse just as well.

While it is true that corporations frequently take advantage of people’s emotions to gain more profit, the people can take advantage of the emotions of the rich to achieve a better world.

After all, we are all built with the same human blueprint, which happens to be geared towards working with and helping out those of the same intrinsic design, because it is evolutionarily advantageous for all of us to do so.

It just happens that the current economic system happens to work against some of our very important evolutionary adaptations, which exist to prevent the very same problems that it, in itself, perpetuates.

This is similar to how cancer arises and becomes a problem when it is able to deactivate the systems it has in place to regulate itself.

While cancer cells would require either a complex internal genetic intervention, or a much simpler immune system intervention, the actions of people in the economy can be influenced by our human analogues to those, namely information and regulatory intervention.

Since we live at a human scale, and can thus share information with ease, not having to go through complex processes like cell recombination, and also because the wealthy, being more reasonable and intelligent than cancer cells, are more likely to listen to reason, the information intervention may be the preferred route.

Unlike cancer cells, the rich can be made aware of the effects of their destructive tendencies and help to fix the problems they are inadvertently contributing to.

Unfortunately, like cancer, wealth inequality can, if not properly navigated, become persistent and unresponsive to treatment, slowly growing and taking up more resources, interfering with, and undermining, the systems that the host needs to stay alive.

However, if the wealthy are aware of this, they can do what cancer cells cannot, and change their behavior knowing that if they continue their current behavior they will kill their host, which is the whole of society, themselves included.

Unfortunately, being just one metaphorical cancer cell among many, they cannot directly stop this wave of regression themselves.

However, since they are engorged with so much surplus resources, they have much at their disposal that they can distribute to those that, if given such resources, would be able to cure the collective cancer currently crippling the economy.
Also, acquainted with the characteristics and mentality of their class, wealthy individuals, when fully integrated into the movement, can provide valuable insight on how people like them live and operate, improving the movement's ability to influence others like them, subsequently improving the methods with which they can be introduced to the cause.

## Synthesizing Systems

Society consists of systems, and at every level, big and small, these systems interact.

These systems work and interact on all different levels, and these interactions can be observed and predicted from all different levels.

A large system, consisting of many smaller systems, can be observed as a whole, and valuable insight can be gleaned from that. It can also be observed in parts, which can give a more detailed view, by analyzing into how single components of it function.

When both of these approaches are synthesized together, a much more descriptive, accurate, and comprehensive framework of understanding can be formed, which provides more functionality, flexibility, and versatility for both analysis of existing systems and formulation of new systems.

Either directly or indirectly, the Central Nervous System is the primary system at the root of everything determining the nature of the economy's operation, and it must be studied to adequately understand the economy.

## Forgoing Functions

The current systems and institutions which determine the nature of the organization of society do not have the functions necessary to be capable of solving the problems of society.

Not only are the current holders of the existing positions of power not qualified themselves to adequately perform their roles and solve social ills adequately, but the positions of power themselves, and the organization, distribution, and features of those positions, regardless of who they are held by, are also fundamentally not capable of adequately managing and mitigating problems which occur within society, serving the interests of the people, or ensuring a better future for the people.

They simply do not have the necessary functions to do so, and trying to simply adjust or moderately reform such antiquated systems to be able to without replacing the frameworks they follow, especially considering also that they are currently run with incompetence and negligence, is a task of so pervasive and complex that it is not worth even being considered to begin with.

## Exponential Economics

In the economy many of the improvements in the structure or dynamics, which determine its function, can compound, in both good and bad ways.

When bad things compound, it has led to some of the largest economic catastrophes in known history.

When good things compound, it has resulted in some of the greatest periods of economic prosperity in history.

The vast majority of the economic solutions presented here are capable of compounding upon each other, as is their intended use.

One of them alone cannot fix all the world’s problems. Technically, they can’t quite do that together either, but they can come much closer to it.

Each new feature added improves the rate of economic development, which compounds on the existing rate and quality of development, which itself may already be increased due to previous features added.

Then, more features can be compounded upon that after that feature is implemented. The result is in an exponentially increasing rate of economic development for each feature.

Of course, while this would deliver immense amounts of flourishing, it is important to understand that it has limits like anything else.

Similar to pretty much anything that improves at an exponential rate, it will eventually run into bottlenecks which need to be painstakingly ironed out, and there will come a turning point where further developing the economic system results in diminishing returns, the same turning point that some current industries, like that of silicon-based computer chips, are coming ever closer to reaching, despite the massive coordination of talent in the industry.

At that point, the point of diminishing returns, the optimal economic system would be reached, and the system can stay as it is, perhaps to one day chance upon a breakthrough and once again restart development.

Reaching the limits to our speed of economic development, though, is a far-off destination, which we are unlikely to reach any time soon, and which hinges on the successful implementation of the system we're creating.

It also doesn’t really constrain the overall size the economy is capable of reaching as a whole, but only the amount of time it takes to reach that size.

Importantly, such an economy would, in my conception, be the most optimal possible while also adequately considering the people within that economy, and no trade-offs should be made between the people and the economy.

Rather, both should be mutually contributing to each other. The economy, after all, should exist to serve the people.

The people should not be enslaved by it in the name of economic growth, but rather all relations between them should be mutual.

Such is the nature of true prosperity.

## Supplanting Systems

Every single person lives their own life. They have their own interests, their own needs, and their own abilities. We cannot rely on everyone to understand the system that surrounds them, and we should not have to.

A system should work effectively with, and for, people. This should be the case whether or not people understand or have any interest in how the system works. It should, regardless, serve their needs.

As it currently is, this is not the case. In the current system one must fill out a resume, and/or have an interview just to earn a chance at getting a job. In not all cases is this job guaranteed to provide enough for one’s needs, either, with wages being what they are.

One also has to learn how to manage their finances. One must control the urge to spend money in a system where industry is actively engaged in finding or innovating new ways to entice people to spend money. One must own a car, in most cases, just to work, because the current system is incapable of providing anything which is cheaper or more convenient.

One also has to actively make decisions about what to buy, which brand, and so on, inside a system which is incentivized to conceal issues in products and over promise their benefits, the result of which creates ambiguity and uncertainty with every purchase.

There is little incentive to manage waste left over from what is purchased, or to make such waste more manageable. The result of this is observable in the difficulty experienced by many in maintaining their houses, with so many miscellaneous belongings, and in the vast landfills that must be dug with an ever-increasing pace.

The proliferation of products using unnecessarily incompatible standards necessitates the purchase and management of more products while providing less convenience.

This results in a frustrating cycle where consumers are forced to continually replace or upgrade their devices, not because they are faulty or outdated, but because they simply do not work with new or different systems. This adds to the financial burden and contributes to an endless stream of waste, further exacerbating environmental degradation.

Healthcare, another critical aspect of our lives, is often inaccessible or prohibitively expensive. Many are forced to choose between basic necessities and medical care, leading to preventable suffering and loss of life.

The insurance system, fraught with complexities and loopholes, often leaves individuals vulnerable at their most desperate times. The lack of transparency and consistency in healthcare pricing and quality further compounds these issues, making it nearly impossible for the average person to make informed decisions about their health.

Education, which should be a pathway to empowerment and opportunity, is instead a source of immense stress and inequality. The cost of higher education has skyrocketed, leaving students and families buried under insurmountable debt.

The quality of education varies drastically depending on socioeconomic status, geography, and other factors, perpetuating cycles of poverty and limiting social mobility. Students are often left ill-prepared for the workforce, with outdated curricula that fail to meet the demands of a rapidly changing job market.

Moreover, the housing market is increasingly out of reach for many. Affordable housing is scarce, and the dream of homeownership is slipping away for the younger generation. Rising rents and property prices force families into precarious living situations, sometimes in substandard conditions. The stress of securing and maintaining a home takes a toll on mental and physical health, undermining the stability that a home should provide.

Transportation systems, as they currently stand, are inadequate and inefficient. Public transportation, where available, is often unreliable, overcrowded, and underfunded. This leaves many with no choice but to rely on personal vehicles, contributing to traffic congestion, pollution, and a significant financial burden. The lack of investment in sustainable and efficient transportation options limits mobility and access to opportunities, disproportionately affecting those in lower-income brackets.

In the workplace, employees are frequently subjected to exploitative practices. Long hours, insufficient wages, lack of job security, and inadequate benefits are common and pervasive issues.

The gig economy, while offering flexibility, often lacks protections and stability, leaving workers vulnerable. The pressure to perform and the constant threat of job loss create a stressful and unsustainable work environment, impacting overall well-being and quality of life.

Despite these systemic failures, there is often a societal expectation for individuals to persevere and succeed through sheer determination and hard work. This narrative ignores the structural barriers that impede progress and places undue blame on individuals for their struggles. It perpetuates a cycle of inequality and disillusionment, where the promise of opportunity is a distant and unattainable ideal for many.

To truly address these universally felt inconveniences, we must acknowledge that the system, as it stands, is fundamentally flawed. It is not enough to make minor adjustments or place the responsibility on individuals to navigate an inherently unjust and inefficient system. We must reimagine and redesign our societal structures from the ground up to serve us, and to alleviate the burdens that they currently impose.
It is only when we uproot the entrenched example set before us, and undermine the hollow justifications surrounding it, that we can supplant the system we behold, establishing a successor sufficient to surpass our stagnant societal state steeped in subjugation.

This is the requirement, if we are to eliminate the burdens restraining the potential held throughout the entire expanse of our society.

We must form our foundations, and stack on our successes, rising above each obstacle, until we possess the power to lift the whole of humanity back up to its feet once more.

We've spent far too long living life on our knees.

It's time for us to take a stand.

## Attributing Affluence

Often people's own biases thwart the pursuit of progress in society.

One of these biases, which distracts people from the true cause of problems, and is frequently demonstrated among people when placing blame, is fundamental attribution error.

Fundamental attribution error is a cognitive bias in which people place disproportionately more weight on the personality or character traits of an individual, rather than their circumstances, when attributing the cause of their behavior.

This leads to the portrayal of people as static and unchanging, when in reality their decisions are shaped by each and every experience they have had up to the moment that they are made, with their circumstances playing an outsized role in the behavior.

In regards to the rich or well off, in conjunction with over-generalizing in general, it leads to the assumption that wealth inherently begets evil or corruption, and frames the wealthy as beyond moral reasoning or emotion.

Intentional or not, such views can actively detract from the goals of a movement, as they exclude the wealthy as potential benefactors.

An Establishment of Influence

I do not see the current political system as the true Democracy it claims to be, but what I call Influocracy, or rule by the most influential. The differences between the two are stark.

Influocracy, as I describe it, has existed long before Democracy, and does not require those in power to act in accordance with the best interests of the people, but instead only in accordance with their own agenda, which tends to be to serve their own interests, and which only aligns with the interests of the people when convenient, like when doing so will increase their political support.

Democracy tends to be the rule of the people by the people, whereas Influocracy tends to be the rule of those people by these people, generally separating people into either the ruling class or the common class, the former being far more exclusive than the latter.

Any system which splits people into the ruling class and the common class cannot be, never will be, and should never be viewed or described as, Democracy, as the latter of these two classes never truly gets much of a say regarding how decisions are made despite the fact that they make up the majority of the population.

In its current form, as politicians represent the interests of their largest donors over that of the people by a considerable margin, it acts more like a representative oligarchy than a representative democracy, with the politicians representing the wealthy first and foremost.

This being the case, the politicians are themselves incredibly wealthy, and indeed it would be hard to make a system which is more biased in favor of the wealthy.

Declaring Dependence

Some in this life may think that they have freedom, that they have complete individual independence. Independence, I ask, from what?

Do they catch their food with their own cunning and outdoor sportsmanship? Do they drive in a vehicle they crafted using their own engineering and mechanical excellence? Did they, as a toddler, feed themselves through their ability to chase down wild animals with their exceptional crawling speed?

No. Needless to say, they did not. And for their entire life, they have relied on others. Their education, their job, their food, their character, and their very idea of independence were enabled by those around them, as is the case for everyone around them. Individuality is not independence. Some people forget that, and conflate the two.

Since organized civilization itself, the enabler of shared and long-term growth and prosperity, requires dependence on others to form from the very beginning, we will always be dependent on the system we live within lest we wither and die in the wilderness.

To even continue human existence, processes must take place which require two people, the product of whom depends on them to exist from their very conception up to the point where they are capable of acquiring enough through their own abilities and circumstances to provide for themselves, find a mate, and start the cycle anew.

The only worthy type of independence that should be fully realized, given that we are forever stuck in a relationship of dependence on others, is the independence from malevolent actors and entities.

When the United States declared independence, it was a declaration of independence from Britain, and from their oppressive rule over the colony. It was not about letting everyone live however they wanted.

While they were lax on religious rights, the religions themselves tended to be a bit puritanical, at least at that time, which was certainly not a recipe for independence.

It was most certainly not a land where one could live independent of others. They were independent only of Britain. Except not even that was true, given that they still traded with them, so perhaps there never was true independence.

It simply wasn't convenient enough to cut ties completely, so it seems the declaration of independence was primarily a political act of self-determination on the part of the United States. Interdependence is simply too great a benefit to give up.

Catalyzing Capabilities

The capabilities of society change with time, as do its needs. Cultural practices are lost and gained through the processes of history. In this context, we can refer to these as cultural mutations.

Oftentimes, these cultural mutations lead to small changes which represent random ideas, events, or the act of selective pressures. Sometimes, however, these mutations lead to new capabilities which result in a dramatic increase of the cognitive capability of those that undergo them. These are cultural gains of function.

Now, this is only half of the story, because, given enough time without a given evolutionary pressure, losses of function can happen just as well. All these things happen not on evolutionary timescales, however.

They mutate at a speed which far outpaces the action of evolution by natural selection by orders of magnitude. Also, they have a trajectory-determining effect, whereby new gains of function are generally followed by more, similar gains of function, as humans have the capability of pattern recognition, as well as the tendency to follow the examples of others, even without being aware of it.

These tendencies and capabilities can be seen, through the lens of cultural evolution, as the result of neurological mechanisms to maximize the speed with which we are capable of evolving and spreading cultural capabilities, and thus as mechanisms which are designed to maximize the speed of cultural evolution, as those more capable of it are also more capable of evolutionarily advantageous behavioral adaptations.

This would explain why, in general, societal change comes in the form of large social movements, and why people are so quick to join the herd without taking the time to think. 

This is the trait that automatically assembles protests and enables mass assemblies. It is the trait that enables strength and coordination of large crowds. It is also this trait that is the greatest enabler of social change.

A trait that is activated by the words and actions of others, especially when these words and actions are coordinated among many different individuals. It is this underlying trait that captures the very essence of what a social movement is.

This is the biggest strength, but also weakness, of humans. Given regular, natural circumstances, people are able to escape from bad social systems through the spreading of evolutionarily advantageous dispositions and behaviors among each other, which gives them significant advantages.

However, this general capability can be corroded with social manipulation and propaganda. It can also be quelled through the suppression and punishment of such activities altogether.

People can be conditioned to justify existing systems, deactivating this trait in themselves and others. They may also believe that their actions will never be significant in the face of large scale problems, entirely oblivious to the true nature of human connection.

When we become aware of these things, though, we become capable of tearing down the façade that is our culturally constructed worldview, removing parasitic functions from their root, generating new functions which enhance our social immune system, and most importantly, achieving far-reaching progress for the whole of society.

It's time we get connected to the world that surrounds us.
In awareness. In collaboration. In influence.
In action.

In everything. 

## Flashback to Former Formation

From the very beginning, life was not its own definitive creation, something which could be separated from the nonliving. Rather, it was a glitch, an unintended occurrence of the universe, which should serve as no surprise given that the universe does not hold intention. Before life, all forms which were to persist had to be incredibly stable, which also generally meant they had to be incredibly large. Life bypassed that requirement through the act of duplication.

However, the dynamics of duplication were very different from the dynamics of stability, and life had a few very interesting features. While the existence of life persisted, the forms representing life changed rapidly. The original form of life, for example, did not persist. Due to the inaccurate nature of the emergent ability of duplication, it was not able to retain its original form. However, far from being a detriment, this inaccuracy was the greatest advantage of life. It was not tied to a single form.

Instead, it was able to manifest in whichever resulting form was most able to successfully persist through duplication. Because of this, life was able to supersede its original form quickly, and then supersede that form, ad infinitum. Because the external environment determines which qualities enable life’s persistence, and because the external environment differs between different locations, different forms of life with different qualities were able to persist in different locations, due to the different conditions in the local environment.

Life diverged into many different lineages, all able to persist in different locations. The only thing which determined the success of a given form of life was the persistence of its existence. Because of that, forms of life began developing qualities which allowed mutually beneficial interaction between its own forms. Eusocial eukaryotes began forming multicellular structures, a foreshadow to our own emergence.

Due to the far greater persistence of such structures, this process accelerated to the point where many of these forms of life become entirely dependent on these structures for survival, unable to exist outside of them.

For this reason, among others, these structures developed their own method of reproduction, one far more sophisticated than the simple duplication of earlier eras. These structures also developed very efficient mechanisms to destroy any cells acting independently of its order before they were able to cause problems.

Cellular independence was crushed, and they were all better off for it. These cells had every part of their existence determined by the needs of the structure. When they were born, when it was their turn to die, and every action in between, which would be very creepy and scary if it weren’t just cells. The structure developed what is, in essence, Totalitarian rule, with a mix of both decentralized and hierarchical structures.

Democracy is pointless for cells, which have no free will, and are primarily just mechanistic structures. And if this was totalitarian rule, cancer was directly analogous to fascism, both of them being a rapidly expanding growth that serves no purpose other than to take more for themselves, which tend to kill off their host and themselves as a product of their unfettered growth.

These Totalitarian structures developed many methods of preventing the emergence and growth of their cellular analogue to fascism, similar to the emergence of Anti-Fascism (Antifa), or the concept of Defensive Democracy, albeit without the existence of any form of cellular democracy.

From there, the structures were able to become more complex and specialize. The features developed, and the things they specialized in, were done in response to the local environment they exist in, which differs depending on which region they found themselves in. These large structures slowly developed to become the many species which exist today, including ourselves.

This, however, is not the end of the story. We, as humans, large multicellular beings in our own right, started developing our own Eusocial tendencies, growing more and more dependent on one another.

We developed to form social structures that ensure the longevity of our society. We distributed resources such that everyone would be most able to continue surviving. We passed knowledge from generation to generation. We did our best to ensure the next generation was prepared for the life we had lived, to keep the order stable, to prevent its disintegration.

And then, somewhere along the line, we enter into the humanity of today, and it is evident that something changed. Something altered our course. Something broke.

We no longer go to great lengths to ensure everyone’s shared longevity. In fact, it seems like we have been increasingly going in the opposite direction.

How could this be? How did we suddenly diverge away from our inherent nature? Why would we attack the prospects of our own long-term survival?

It is because of the sheer scale of modern society, and our ongoing failure to manage it. Most of the current global problems can be boiled down to negligence, mismanagement, dysregulation, and poor systems design.

Humanity scaled up, but those benefiting from regressive and repressive social systems blocked social improvements, either not understanding or not caring about the catastrophic impact their actions would have. This is despite it being in their best interest, from an evolutionary perspective, to help ensure everyone’s survival and wellbeing.

Industries blocked regulation, the rich blocked wealth distribution, politicians blocked fair political representation. And this was within the economic framework of Capitalism, which was already, when scaled to the size of industrialized society, comically bad at serving the needs of individuals and society as a whole.

It should come as no surprise that society is in such a state of slow self-destruction. Those at the top were blinded to the state of their own kind by their wealth and power, and they assumed selfishness was to their own evolutionary advantage in their folly.

As it was, many of those with power and wealth supported the idea of social Darwinism in the recent past; perhaps some still do. The sheer irony here is that by following such a path, which was based on a few simple principles of evolution, they acted in ways that ran directly counter to their own evolutionary best interests.

In ignorance, they beat down the very ones which make up the foundation they stand on, without any regard for the dangers they created for the public, and for future generations, in doing so. They undermined the stability of the ongoing existence of humanity in their petty pursuit of power, and their way of thinking has permeated all aspects of society.

Yet we must remind ourselves that such a way of thinking is detrimental to every aspect of what makes us human, and what sustains humanity itself. A wake-up call is in order. If we are neglected by those above us, and if they have no interest in furthering our interests, let us do things amongst ourselves, ignoring their order, rules, and demands with contempt.

Let us write our own laws, and form our own social structures and contracts. Let us show them our true ability when we are free of their endless engine of extraction. When we surpass them in every conceivable metric, they will be able to see themselves for the fools they really are, and have been all along.

## Evolution by Exploitation

Language used within the science of evolution and natural selection are often co-opted to support free-market ideals, resulting in what can be called the Theory of Evolution by Free Market, with claims that companies will naturally evolve to become better and more efficient, and that natural selection alone results in the most efficient mode of progress.

However, this is highly misleading.

Aside from being slow, evolution works on the scale, and for the fitness, of that which is evolving. It is businesses that are evolving, so it works to make them more persistent.

Likewise, it selects only for that which is best able to take advantage of its environment to reinforce its own existence, and not for that which is best for its environment.

Such characteristics result in the exploitation of people by businesses to enrich their owners and shareholders.

## Turning to Trust

The importance of trust goes beyond what meets the eye, for it is crucial even for things as fundamental as math or engineering.

If one cannot trust four plus four to equal eight consistently, then math will be unpredictable and untrustworthy, and thus practically useless for calculations.

This is obvious, but one must consider the many methods of calculation used in the past that were unreliable, that are not used nowadays for that reason.

Trust is a fundamental necessity for technological development as well, a crucial driver of economic growth and improvement.

On the lowest level, one must be able to reasonably trust that the science behind the technology works in the first place, and that it is sufficient to use as a resource in developing said technology.

If one knows that 5 plus 8 is 13 to begin with, then one does not need to do all the math manually to prove it. Trust, in this way, functions as a heuristic. A heuristic that has the capability of allowing modern life as we know it to exist.

Imagine what life would be like if we could not trust in the result of an equation, of the meaning of a word, or in the rigor of scientific method. Yet all of these fundamentally rely on the heuristic of trust to be useful.

Even knowledge of truth itself relies on trust, which is important to be aware of because disinformation also requires trust to be effective, and the two cannot always be easily distinguished between.

One must be capable of distinguishing reliable signals from faulty ones. The more areas in which one is capable of distinguishing the two, the more accurate one will be overall.

Our placement of trust determines our potential in accurately understanding the world around us. At the end of the day, judgment is our most powerful tool in maintaining veracity.

## The Origin of Information

Information is the end result of people finding various ways of describing the world by simplifying it.

All of our language, math, etcetera, are abstractions.

Math is not an inherent feature of the universe, but is capable of predicting things within it.

A word is not inherent of a given object but it's still used to evoke it in conversation.

All philosophical processes, including things like the scientific method, are abstract concepts which we use to describe or interpret reality, as processes to convert reality into usable abstractions of reality.

The human brain tends to be better at operations and calculations using discrete bits of information, so we prefer to use things like letters, punctuation, numbers, operators, and other symbols.

All of these symbols are standardized so as to be able to convey said information without misinterpretation.

In the same way, the brain and the senses are designed to interpret reality efficiently. We only have a compressed picture of reality, optimized by evolutionary pressures to suit our specific requirements.

The entirety of our experience is just a shifting, pulsing network of electrical signals in our brain, and as soon as that electrical network stops...

We are dead.

Now...

Consider that spoken and written language, math, science, philosophy, and every other tool we use to create and to share our understanding of the world are limited to the capability of those responsible for their development, and not necessarily the best or even the most accurate given what is possible.

There is always a different perspective, a different way to calculate, a different way to view the world.

What process we use determines which answers we are able to draw out from reality.

The only limit is our creativity.

## To Gain Function

A gain of function, in Intramutualism, refers to the acquisition or enhancement of a specific capability or function in any system or component. It involves a modification or change that results in improved performance, new abilities, or increased effectiveness.

This concept is applied broadly to any system where advancements or enhancements lead to new or improved functions, contributing to the versatility, capability, and general advancement.

For example, if a tool is modified to be more versatile or efficient, it has undergone a gain of function. Likewise, when a person learns a new skill or improves an existing one, they experience a gain of function.

In general terms, a gain of function signifies any improvement or addition that enhances the ability to perform certain tasks or achieve specific outcomes. This concept can be applied broadly to many areas, such as biology, technology, personal development, and social change.

# Proposals

## Enforcing Accountability

A system must enforce subordination of the politicians to the system rather than the other way around, with politicians remaining subordinate to the system, and the system remaining subordinate to the citizens.

This means having mechanisms designed to automatically remove and replace leaders when they act out of line, enforcing standards and ensuring that the rules of the system apply to those tasked with operating it.

Additionally, it may be for the best that politicians, working closely with the system and thus well positioned to observe flaws and spot potential improvements, be given the option to submit proposed changes to the system for review.

## Linking Learning

To create more intelligent, well-rounded citizens, a system of education should take a novel approach to teaching. It should not take the standard route of just cramming random knowledge into kids’ brains and hoping something comes in handy. Instead, it should take a far more efficient route by looking at teaching through the lens of transmitting gains of function to students. 

By prioritizing the most useful gains of function, and maximizing the total value of the overall gains of function which are provided in a given time frame, or amount of effort on behalf of the student, many of the things taught would be of significant value and utility, which contrasts sharply with all the useless things currently taught in schools.

This would be done by selecting the knowledge which enables the most valuable functions in a given amount of time, and then creating a lesson plan which teaches it quickly and intuitively, to effectively enable the desired function for students, and in an interesting and entertaining way if such is achievable.

It must be noted that some gains of functions require other gains of functions to be present before they can be acquired. In a basic example, one must know how to draw letters before writing words, one must know how to write words before making sentences, one must know how to make sentences before writing paragraphs, and so on. 

The gains of function which are most frequently required for other gains of function should be given higher priority, and a map of the relationships between functions can be made to ensure that each gain of function is transmitted in the proper order, preventing confusion and misunderstandings.

There are also gains of function that may be included in this map which, though not explicitly required, can increase the ease with which students are able to take in other specific gains of function, and also likely increase their ability to use such gains of function.

It's time we make schools that actually function.

## Streamlining Schooling

As almost all subjects are somewhat interrelated and rely on or can complement functions provided within each other, an overall more cohesive framework could be utilized, primarily based on the order of functions and not on the separation of topics.

If a function from one topic can reduce the time and effort required to gain a function in another, this increases the efficiency of learning. Not only that, but it increases the richness and cohesiveness of the knowledge, and thus ability, which is gained.

Such a method would result in more connections and relations built up to provide references and analogies, helping students understand and learn things better. As such, there is no reason to explicitly separate topics and classes from each other, as doing so restricts the speed and efficacy with which things can be taught and learned.

Separating topics into different categories creates arbitrary barriers in a world that consists of a single, cohesive reality, and likely reduces the creativity of students, their ability to find novel solutions, and their ability to see the bigger picture.

We can instead just have one topic, known as either teaching or learning, depending on the perspective. Literature, Mathematics, and all the others would all fall under that topic, and be mapped out into functions, so the optimal chronological order of functions could be reached, and implemented into curriculum.

This would result in lessons based entirely on the matters of reality they correspond to, rather than as subjects separated by arbitrary barriers which do not exist for any reason other than academic stratification, which is itself a problem to be countered by uniting the insights of different fields into a complete whole.

Such interconnected and integrated lessons would provide a more complete picture of reality, enabling within students the ability to apply their knowledge to a much greater extent, and to a much larger range of areas.

They would help students be able to more easily operate with accuracy entirely independently of any authoritative source, spotting inconsistencies between things being presented and reality, through basic skills that schools currently do not teach.

## Reinforcing Reciprocity

If one can trust that socially and economically beneficial activities will be rewarded, then one is far more likely to partake in such activities. This would then reinforce and perpetuate helpful behavior.

Now, in this manner, when someone invents something that is beneficial for society, a good economic system would reward them for it, and proportionally to their contribution. It should give credit where credit is due, reinforcing beneficial behavior which drives it forward.

Likewise, even for more personal problems, whether a neighbor in need or a stranger in a sticky situation, an economic system that is well designed should have systems in place to facilitate the rewarding of altruistic acts one carries out, roughly proportional to the benefit provided to others in doing so.

## Expediting Education

In school, tasks and lessons should not be made any more difficult, complicated, or time-consuming than absolutely necessary for the successful transmission of a given gain of function unless it can be proven that such qualities will improve the students’ overall ability to apply the specific gain of function being transmitted to them, and to enough of an extent that it would adequately justify the extra time and effort which must be put into receiving a given gain of function.

To do otherwise would be to waste time and effort which could have been used to learn other topics. This is not to imply a sole focus on directly applicable knowledge like those in the STEM fields, without regard to the social sciences or softer subjects.

All subjects would most certainly still be taught, but with an approach which provides more relevant, actionable knowledge, and emphasizes the uses, significance, and implications of the knowledge provided.

After all, knowledge which has no use or significance in reality is not relevant for anything which pertains to reality. 

## Connecting Creativity

Our approach should rely on what allowed humans to dominate the planet in the first place, a feat which would not have been possible through natural selection alone: Collaboration. Collaboration has, throughout history, been behind every successful civilization, every great empire, manifesting in many of the greatest achievements of mankind.

The greatest monuments of human achievement have been achieved through collaboration, including great cities and architectural marvels, as well as industrially-produced goods. Collaboration has been proven to bring forth great progress for society, far more than one could rely on natural selection alone to provide.

Collaboration has unlocked more human potential in thousands of years than natural selection could achieve in billions of years. Language itself, with which I am conveying this, is a product of social collaboration, both spoken, written, signed, and so on.

There is also another reason behind the success of humans, and that is standardization. With a rise in collaboration, there arises a need for standardization, so as to allow for more effective collaboration. Through many successful civilizations there has arisen written language, and not for its own sake, but for the sake of setting standards of meaning, to allow better collaboration.

This approach has enabled some of the greatest creations mankind has ever made. It is because of this that much of our modern world is even capable of existing, from electricity, thanks to standards of the electrical grid, to the internet, thanks to the Ethernet standard among other standards established in the 1980s.

Things like garden hoses, power cables, engines, mechanic’s tools, lightbulbs, and much else, all standardized, and for good reason. Standards set the foundation upon which all else can be built.

Yet there is more that has allowed mankind’s success. We must also consider innovation, by which all standards and creations are envisioned from the very beginning.

Without collaboration, innovation will have miniscule impact, never being known outside of oneself, and without innovation, collaboration will never yield improvements over the status quo.

Even with both of these, though, innovations cannot be as easily understood, managed, furthered, or implemented without standardization. It is when the act of innovation is encouraged, and the standards are established, that the most progress is made, thanks to all working together in harmony.

Let it thus be known that, among humans, the progress of civilization does not come about through natural selection alone, but through collaboration, standardization, and innovation. That is how it has always been for mankind, and the requirements for progress remain the same as they were thousands of years ago, unchanged.

## Amplifying Autonomy

How should we continue an order, once it is established? That is, after a generation manages to establish a better order, how should they bring forth the subsequent generations? There are things which are advisable to ensure that the current order does not degenerate into an order which is just as bad as the one before.

In education, children should be taught their rights, the reasons for them, how to be sure that they are present and not being diminished, and what the consequences could be if they were to allow them to be taken away from them.

There should be mechanisms in place that allow and encourage students to actively determine how the school is run. There should also be roles they can play and positions they can hold, where they are actively engaged in running different aspects of the school, various projects, or even external organizations and institutions if they show sufficient skill.

It is necessary to teach children their rights, rights which enable their freedom and disable the threat of tyranny. By doing so, it strengthens the power that freedom holds over those who wish to take it away, as these children, when they become adults, will then easily detect when their rights are being whittled away so they can act in time to restore them, willing to go to great lengths to safeguard them, and conscious of what constitutes an infringement on the rights of others, thus able to avoid inflicting one.

It is necessary to prepare children so they are used to having mechanisms which give them the power to, of their own free will, determine how the system they reside within is run, for this mindset is necessary so that they can understand and sustain the order as adults, and it doesn't hurt for them to be accustomed to engaging actively in the political system, as it tends to be the case that higher civic engagement improves government outcomes across the board.

The mechanisms within the school should be designed to resemble, and prepare students for, the same mechanisms which would be in place for all citizens for the purpose of keeping government actions bound to the interests of the people. School should largely mirror the world that students are being prepared for, so that they pick up on habits, skills, and experiences early on that can be directly applied later in life, making things far easier for everyone.

Children should be trained to have the ability, and be given the mechanisms, to make decisions for their own future. This would ensure that the next generation remains dedicated to the unfinished work of restraining and guiding their government, the work which they who came before them have thus far so nobly advanced. The work which ensures that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

As such, it is necessary to prepare children so they are used to taking on important roles inside the system they reside within, for several reasons. To begin with, it would provide them with confidence and familiarity with such roles. This confidence and familiarity, in turn, increases the autonomy with which they can operate, which increases their performance. The self-reliance and independence gained from this increases their overall freedom and ability to take appropriate action in the case of government overreach.

They would become more competent and reliable in company, institutional, or governmental positions of leadership. Importantly, a societal introduction of this nature would provide critical real-life experience, and, in doing so, accelerate the development of confidence and skill necessary for the performing of vital societal roles, rather than operating on infantilization as current schooling does.

## Acquiring Authority

If a movement gains legitimacy and authority within a given region, it can slowly surpass the regional government and become the primary authority in the region.

It should also, if possible, work with the existing regional government during the transition of power, as this will help to ensure that the transfer goes smoothly.

So long as the people in a given region support the movement, and so long as the movement is capable of performing the role of the government, it will surpass the existing power structures and establish itself in the region.

After all, once a population begins to listen to the authority of a new movement rather than the existing government, the new one movement becomes the de-facto government itself.

It may even become the official government if it becomes recognized by other governing bodies.

Either way, it cements its position as the law of the locality, and can then rule according to its values and wisdom.

## Peer Politics

The system would be designed around mechanisms which record every decision a politician makes, capable of easily demoting, promoting or terminating their role outside of their control.

The politicians have no say in this. The people are put first in the system, and politicians have to work by rules set by the people, as a small part in a machine that knows their every move, knowing the consequences if they step out of line.

The rules and structures of the system, and any changes to them, are implemented through the people using a commit and peer review process based off of the same secure architecture as the likes of Git and Blockchain, with a transparent peer review process performed by those who have verified their competence and trustworthiness in the network.

There are actually several ideas that together create this system here. There is, for one, a system of implementation based on Merkle trees.

This means anyone can suggest or outline a system feature, which then goes through a secure verification process.

This securely and smoothly facilitates the input of the public regarding how the system should work or be modified, while maintaining responsible standards of review for all proposals in a review process that is carried out transparently.

So, with this, people's ideas are effectively coordinated, the system remains manageable, and only proposals found to have a net positive impact on society, be it directly or indirectly, are verified, with two potential options for implementation following verification:

Option one: An organization or bureaucracy which only answers to the network, and thus the people, implementing changes directly to the political structure as soon as they pass the verification process.

Option two: A general interface, protocols, social processes, and/or social structures which enable and coordinate people in the activity of implementing changes to the structure in place, keeping it up to spec, and maintaining it in general, with roles performed through volunteer or as a civic duty.

Option two is more provisional, and would carry more burden for the public to operate directly, but could also carry the benefit of direct civic engagement, if there is such a benefit to be had in those regards.

## Preparing Potential

There are things that must be done to integrate organizations, movements, and individuals into the main movement.

While their existing abilities may be useful to an extent, they should be prepared to go beyond what their preexisting abilities permit, and gain new functions to further enable their effective contribution as needed.

A training course and guidelines could be formulated for this purpose. A basic course can be created, and then built upon as members introduce unique skills that provide sufficient advantage and value to be included in the course.

This can be refined and advanced over time, but it should include basic information like the goals, history, and techniques of the movement, as well as the various roles, their requirements, the ways that one can best contribute in any given role, and what the movement offers in return.

It should, of course, be kept interesting and without excessive or unnecessary requirements.

## An Amplifying Alliance

How can a movement make alliances with outside entities?

The more allies a movement has, the more legitimacy and public recognition it holds.

For every civil society organization, grassroots organization, political movement, business, or institution allied with a movement, the movement grows in legitimacy, popularity, and capacity.

A movement can have mutually beneficial alliances with other organizations and serve to coordinate activities among them, forming a ragtag coalition with a single well-organized movement as an intermediary.

A movement could set up a management system using checks, balances, alignments, and proportionality which spans itself and all allies, making each of them extensions of each other, and also more effectively coordinating and managing them, provided the allies agree to such a proposition.

Potential allies that come to mind include the likes of Las Altos Hills Community Fiber, Wikimedia Foundation, Habitat for Humanity, The Green Thumb Initiative, Community Tech Network, Repair Café, Housing Development Alliance, Urban Roots, Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Public Knowledge, Free Software Foundation (FSF), Creative Commons, Hackerspaces, Tool libraries, and similar entities with similar goals oriented towards the common good.

Such organizations have much to offer as potential allies. They offer expertise in their field, principles and philosophies which can be adopted, organizational structures which can be learned from, and another branch of like-minded people working towards the greater good as an organization.

Our movement is intended to be a hub of innovation, research and development, knowledge sharing, and coordination. Not solely for that of individuals, but also among allied organizations.

Such an approach should serve to improve the organization, management, practices, and available tools and technology among its allies, while also finding ways of increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations.

This would strengthen them individually and as a whole. It could also find ways in which various allies can supplement each other, improving collaboration and cohesion among organizations.

Alone, many of these organizations are quite limited in size and scope.

Together, things become possible which were previously mere pipe dreams.

Alone, many of them don't have a very large potential for expansion, due to their very nature, which is to serve the public good over the pursuit of profits or expansion.

Together, and with faster development, more efficient operations, greater stability, and better, more effective management brought about by collaboration, each organization’s potential for expansion would dramatically increase, enabling for each the ability to serve more communities and regions.

Of course, to expand these services, at least while the coalition of organizations is unable to provide for the means to do so itself, it would have to work within the Capitalist system, and a trade-off would have to be made.

Organizations would have to raise money to be able to purchase the means necessary to expand operations to other communities.

This can be done by asking prospective communities themselves if they are willing to pay for an expansion of operations to their regions, through crowdfunding and donations, or by the cold, hard, and slightly less sentimental business logic of capitalism – through profits.
Regardless of how the money is made, with a few exceptions of course, such a trade-off is necessary to make, for the value gained by such services and enterprises most certainly merits paying a small price to increase public access to them, and doing so would also strengthen the coalition by expanding its reach, strengthening its public support, and potentially increasing membership.

## Protecting Progress

How can a movement ensure its ongoing existence?

While personally it feels unlikely that those taking advantage of the current system would go out of their way to undermine such a movement, there remains the risk of the new movement or system being undermined or destroyed before being able to adequately establish itself or gain a sufficient foothold within the population.

While unlikely, and certainly not the biggest barrier to entry in the creation of a movement, this possibility should at least be considered to stay on the safe side, so things can be put in place beforehand to provide a higher level of safety against such events.

A movement can deter potential adversaries through various means. It can have proactive measures put in place, like making themselves appear more innocuous and corporate-friendly to potential adversaries, avoiding public controversy, and avoiding unwanted attention in general.

It can also employ more reactive measures, should it be the case that it is targeted, such as triggering public backlash through its supporters by revealing the activities of a given aggressor.

It could also send out an ambassador, of the persuasive nature, to change the mind of a given aggressor, and to convince a given adversary that such hostile actions do not serve their interests. Such would provide a decent amount of protection for a movement.

If there is a coordinated or concerted effort against it, a movement should try to become impervious to attempts which aim to disband or eliminate it, regardless of the power disparities that may exist between their adversaries and themselves.

It should be able to improve the lives of others regardless of what the rich and powerful have to say about the matter, and be able to achieve its goals even while being targeted directly.

## Shifting Society

There is a strategy well known in the world of war, which we know by the name of Asymmetric Warfare, that serves as a good description of one of the most effective roads towards social change. It can be summed up in five words, “Do more with less, creatively”.

However, rather than maximizing damage and destruction, as is the way of war, we can instead maximize the positive influence one has on society as a whole. It is not difficult to see the advantages of this tactic.

The average person has an average amount of influence on those around them. However, if an individual has a strategy, a plan, a motive, and/or an end goal in mind, they can influence those around them to an extent which dwarfs that of the average individual with ease.

One can ensure that wisdom which bears repeating will be repeated, and will do so on many occasions, by many people, under many circumstances. To do so, one must study how information spreads, finding the features shared by the most pervasive bits of knowledge, and apply that knowledge to curate select bits of knowledge into a format designed to spread effectively.

When one makes a good argument once, then, it is not just for one’s audience, but also the audience of one’s audience, along the entire journey it makes from person to person, tracing paths of profound realization and understanding throughout the entire social fabric it emerged from, far outlasting the original conversation or speech in which it was uttered to touch the hearts, to enlighten the minds, and to influence the actions, of millions.

## Bottom-Based Bureaucracy

It may be best to keep decisions low-level, only creating hierarchy where absolutely necessary. Thus, decisions would be made based on the perspective of the people closest to the situation.

The lowest level of the bureaucratic system is the people of which the decisions being made effect (i.e. citizens, residents, stakeholders, whatever. Those guys). If and when they alone are sufficient to make the decisions, they can be the ones which make them, in effect crowdsourcing decision making, and placing it in the hands of those most impacted by the decisions made.

This would be presented as a responsibility for citizens, similar to things like jury duty.

When the stakeholders themselves are insufficient for decision making within a given area, for whichever reason, the decision would be outsourced to whichever actor, process, or organization is most suited for the decision-making task in question.

## Investing in Integrity

Let’s talk about the stock market.

I never really wondered about this, but I ended up facing the truth of the matter regardless: What would happen if there was a gambling racket, or a casino, in which well-informed individuals believed that they, rather than losing money, would actually gain money instead? What results would we see?

The answer can be seen in stock market speculation, market bubbles, and finally a collapse or recession.

The illusion of continually increasing prosperity keeps people excited, and then the illusion shatters before their eyes as the stock market goes into freefall, leaving only the most talented or well-equipped investors in the game, who play them like suckers and leave with their money.

In that way, the stock market can be seen as one of the most successful gambling rackets in history.

That is not to say that one cannot make money from it, but that the way it operates is inherently detrimental to people’s overall prospects.

Also, the fact that returns can be made, and that some can even make a steady living off of investing, only serves to further the fervor with which people gamble away their life savings doing it.

It simply makes it more addictive, and in turn, more detrimental to society.

Further evidence of the casino-like nature of investing can be seen in ads promising the “jackpot” for investing in a given company, taking advantage of survivorship bias by frequently elevating and talking about people who became massively successful from the stock market, and preying on people’s gullibility and lack of education or knowledge on the subject, as well as their fear of missing out.

Things like this are strategies employed by the gambling industry as well, and are very effective at not just taking advantage of people, but also at ruining their lives.

So basically, the stock market is like a casino that takes advantage of regular people, and even when people do invest in something that delivers returns, it is still misallocated investment, and the companies that tend to deliver the most returns tend to be the most exploitative in nature.

Investing should be done on behalf of society, not in the pursuit of finding better methods to take advantage of the weaknesses of society.

It would be better if we replace this system of trading stocks with a more effective system, designed specifically to invest in the areas most advantageous to society, aimed at delivering a high return on investment for everyone, collectively.

Such would be far more responsible, and effective, than to rely on a giant glorified casino to decide our financial fate. After all, it’s not like it would be unable to make use of skilled investors after their previous revenue source is wiped out to clear its way.

Maybe then the investors could actually serve to provide some amount of value to society.

## Predictions of Provisions

The movement will, out of necessity, develop structures for diplomacy, decision making, economic management, social management, law making, and law enforcement, as is done by every other governmental entity.

These developments cannot be avoided, but they can be improved substantially over the previous structures.

They can be designed to be fairer and more effective, allowing members of society to make more decisions for themselves wherever possible.

Additionally, an established movement should be open to potential improvements proposed by any given member of society, setting up various systems of feedback and improvement, to prevent structural stagnation of the system.

## Marginalizing Society

For anyone unfamiliar with the term, profit margins refer to the percentage of income a business has left over after paying expenses. In other words, this is the money that goes to the owners of the company, and it is this money which motivates their actions. These actions, however, can prove problematic.

As profit margins provide the incentives for, and are thus the main driving force behind, company investment and actions, problems occur.

This is due to the fact that profit margins are unequal across industries, regardless of the value provided by those industries, which means that rather than investing in areas that strike a healthy balance between providing value and making profits, the agenda of corporations are skewed towards industries that provide as little value as possible for as much money as possible.

While this may be an indirect consequence of the incentive to make as much money with as little cost as possible, and while such an incentive does tend to increase efficiency, it also leads to dominant business practices which can only fairly be described as exploitative and rent-seeking. This is problematic.

As profit is not correlated with value created, but instead simply with wealth extracted on top of the existing price, the result is that economic investment becomes detached from reality. Simply put, it creates a situation of perpetual economic malinvestment that becomes entrenched within the system.

This is the reason Capitalism is often described as “putting profits over people”. This is what causes it. Rather than investing in things beneficial to people, this makes it so that investment is only placed on things able to extract the most money from people, after operating costs are accounted for.

In this way, the allocation of investment resources is incredibly inefficient, simply due to the method on which the market currently operates. Also, and importantly, this problem cannot be fixed without fundamentally changing some of the most basic features underpinning the current economic system.

Profit margins could be kept at a set amount, and that could fix a lot of the associated issues, but there might just be a better, more sophisticated way to do this.

We could simply have an economic regulation system, using knowledge on the unit cost, research and development costs, and of the overall societal and economic impact of the product or service produced, to set the profit margins and hence profits.

This would make it so that, rather than companies being able to set their prices arbitrarily, they are decided externally, preventing self-serving behavior. Their profits are thus constrained by the societal and economic impact of their products and services, and thus their profits are more closely tied to the actual value their products or services contribute to society.

Because of that, investment would then occur in areas deemed to provide higher societal and economic benefit, subsequently benefiting society and the economy. Such would also give the companies themselves a greater purpose than simply maximizing profits at the expense of literally everyone.


## Engineering an Order

Checks and balances, in government, are mainly passive features that are designed to prevent consolidation of power. People’s natural penchant for craftiness and trickery ensures that such checks and balances are easily bypassed, internally and externally.

It is not through checks and balances alone that we will achieve an ideal power dynamic. We must also have other ways.

It is insufficient solely to check, keeping government entities accountable to each other, or to balance, keeping the power of government entities evenly distributed.

We must also align, implementing effective mechanisms to guide the interests of those in positions of power according to the best interests of the people that are affected by their decisions.

We should use checks, balances, and alignments. By aligning interests, we can achieve a power dynamic which is more mutually beneficial.

We cannot assume politicians have our best interests in mind, unless we deliberately design the power dynamics and incentives so that the motives and thus the behavior of politicians reflect the best interests of those whose lives they affect.

But one must not be deceived to believe that alignment alone is sufficient. There must also be proportionality.

The amount of attention given to the performance of a given role should be based on how many people that role affects, the extent of which it affects them, the likelihood and significance of potential mistakes, and the amount of improvement that more attention given to that area is able to bring.

Even if someone’s interests are aligned with their constituents entirely, they alone may not be able to perform their role effectively enough to serve their constituents interests adequately.

As such, a given role or duty should be given the proper attention and resources in proportion to the effect it has.

Automation should be used to lower both the amount of labor and the amount of bureaucracy required to run the government.

If a given role can be more effectively performed through partial or complete automation, that should be done.

If the performance of automated processes is equivalent or worse than non-automated processes, such automation should primarily be done only in places where the impact of errors are more trivial, and where the use of human labor for such tasks is too inefficient to be justified.

## Enabling Economic Ascension

Both workers and owners should receive payment according to the work they do, and the net result it has towards the improvement in conditions towards society.

For workers, wages would be determined by the effectiveness in which they contribute to society in their current role. Thus, they have every incentive to seek out roles in which they will more effectively contribute to society.

For owners, wages are determined by both the effectiveness in which they contribute to society in their current role, as well as by the net increase of worker productivity that they facilitate in the economy through their company.

There would thus be a bonus granted to the owner of a company for each worker hired, in proportion to the worker's net increase in effectiveness in contributing to society over their prior role in a the economy.

This bonus would be continuous, diminishing over time at a rate which, alongside the ratio between net productivity increase and bonus granted, would be calculated by using accurate psychological models of motivation to establish a mathematical relationship predicting the behavioral outcome for any given rate or ratio, and feeding the resulting equations into a fund distribution optimization function, designed to target the best societal outcome, mathematically deriving the optimal rate and ratio while accounting for all the other economic factors.

However, if a hiring leads to a net decrease in a worker's effectiveness at contributing to society, this same system would come into play, levying a penalty towards the owner of a company in proportion to the decrease in effectiveness. This would act as a ratchet mechanism, ensuring that workers only increase in their effectiveness at contributing to society.

Given that this itself is what wages are determined by, it would also ensure that wages only increase, bringing upwards mobility with it, as well as the progressive intensification of societal benefit.

If a business cannot increase their productivity then the business eventually fails, because a higher paying company will just hire all their workers, leaving them with none. In this way, lower productivity and less societally beneficial jobs simply go extinct.

Due to the way that pay would be determined for business owners, business owners would be incentivized to hire as many employees as possible from lower productivity areas.

Thus, so long as there happens to be lower productivity labor, they would have every incentive to scale their business massively to hire that labor, benefiting their prospective employees with higher wages, and benefiting society by contributing more effectively to it.

These dynamics would pressure the owners of companies to increase performance per person in the economy as a whole. They would actively compete for employees, seeking out the lowest productivity workers meeting the job requirements for their company's higher productivity positions.

This would strategically drive upwards mobility where it matters the most, with business owners primarily interested in maximizing the net productivity increase for each worker they hire.

Additionally, this creates an incentive to innovate highly productive businesses that run primarily on unskilled or underappreciated labor, as such labor is lower paid, presenting a far greater payoff to anyone capable of creating a company that can make more productive use of it.

In doing so, it would drive upward mobility, and increased productivity, even for those that present the least amount of value in the form of skill or expertise. Even for those that have lost all hope.

In such a system, the most sought-after workers would be the people in society which, at the moment, are the most desperate for a job. This forms a virtuous cycle, reducing poverty reliably as a feature of the system.

Rather than the race to the bottom with wages seen in Capitalism, this approach creates a race to the top.


## Ambitious in Expansion

Even if the movement ends up enveloping an entire nation, it should not stop there, for there are other places where people are not well off, and where suffering happens.

It should spread to developing nations, bringing them the benefit of a reign of benevolence, and lifting them out of relative poverty to meet the rest of the world in standards of living.

Of course, much can happen between the founding and multinational expansion, so it is important to have methods of ensuring that the movement will stay benevolent, and aligned with the needs and interests of everyone it is entrusted to take care of.

So long as that is adequately addressed, however, it may be possible to simply continue expanding until there is nowhere else to expand to, uniting billions and quite literally serving the interests of all.

## Structures for Success

This movement should, early on, establish organizational structures dedicated to performing various tasks.

This is critical because it allows the movement some time to experiment with how these structures can be formed and how they operate, so they can be fine-tuned to work effectively.

This is the stage where structures for managing activity, formulating strategies, and preventing power consolidation would be first implemented.

This is where it becomes less embryonic and more defined, and where its capability starts to increase, subsequently increasing its membership and growth.

## Prioritizing Prosperity

Let’s make a better metric for economic prosperity.

To create this metric, we will take a tiered approach, so that the most important factors to economic health are given the greatest weight.

This will go from from most to least important. Starting with water, and followed by food, clothing, shelter, safe or clean air, sanitation, basic home appliances, healthcare, education, means of transportation, electricity, internet, etcetera.

The order would, of course, be optimized to best reflect the quality of life of all citizen, meaning things like mental and physical health would be weighed in the overall calculations.

Now, for each individual tier, we can assign it a value tied to its importance, which I will call the “Need Factor”. The Need Factor is a number between 0 and 100, 0 being entirely unnecessary and/or useless, and 100 being required for survival.

Then, for each tier, we can find the percentage of the population for which that need is fulfilled, which we can call the “Pop. Percent”.

We can multiply the Pop. Percent and the Need Factor together to get the “Tier Prosperity Indicator”. Since the maximum for both of these variables is 100, the maximum possible result is 10,000.

Now, the Need Factor for each tier will only need to be calculated once, and won’t change. The Pop. Percent is what measures performance, and would change based on how many people have access to various things.

Now, we can multiply the Need Factor by 100 for each and add them together to get the most ideal possible score, and use that as our upper limit.

Let’s make an example, for all the mathematicians reading this; assuming Need Factor equals 69.4, and Pop. Percent equals 54 for a given tier, this is what the math looks like, in three different representations:

[NF=69.4] × [PP=54] = [TPI=3747.6]
(69.4 × 54 = 3747.6) ≡ (NF × PP = TPI)
NF=69.4 PP=54 TPI=3747.6 | NF × PP = TPI.

However, we are not quite done yet. That is because we must do this for every tier that is included in the metric.

Once we do the calculations to get the Tier Prosperity Indicator for each tier, we take the Tier Prosperity Indicator for each tier and add them all together to reach a final number, which is the Tiered Economic Prosperity Benchmark, or TEPB.

The TEPB is our final result, and the higher it is, the more economic prosperity there is. This shows us a much better picture of how the economy is doing as far as the people within it are concerned.

It serves as a far more appropriate measure of economic prosperity than GDP, namely because it represents the stats that affect lives the most.

Because the more important tiers, like access to water and food, have a larger Need Factor, they will influence the final result far more than the more trivial factors, and thus they would be prioritized by those seeking to improve the metric, namely those that write the laws and decide the policies.

## Mediating Misdemeanors

I came up with the idea of having real life drama police...

Uhhh...
Hear me out.

Socially competent officers trained to address drama-related problems.

They would have instructions to treat common scenarios, like when both parties consider themselves in the right.

Thus, many gray zone situations of law could be approached, subsequently documented by officers in order to provide valuable insight, and organized by types of cases from most to least common.

Other factors may include severity and rate of detection/reporting vs rate of unreported or undetected incidents.

They could also play the role as mediator and perform de-escalation.

## Integrating Industrial Innovation

There should be a standardized interface between each separable segment of any given production line to enable interoperability between each segment in the production process regardless of the company which holds ownership of it.

To ensure the maximum benefits of interoperability between processes, there could be situational penalties and bonuses in place for companies to keep all segments of production open for transfer of ownership to other companies which are able to better run them, so long as the overall economic benefits of higher efficiency and/or better quality gained through doing so outweigh the overall economic costs of reorganizing, retooling, and/or whatever else must be done to facilitate such a transfer.

The penalty for blocking such a transfer of ownership would be proportional to the calculated net benefit which went unrealized due to the rejection of approval, due to net loss of economic productivity, and there would be minor kickbacks given to a company upon their allowing of such a transfer to take place.

Such occurrences would, by requirement, be coordinated by both parties.

This would make the industrial environment more open and more flexible. It would also enable companies that specialize and become very capable in one specific process or role, one which is a common process or role in many companies, to come about.

By taking control of one specific segment or role within many different companies, and thus being able to streamline that specific process to the maximum, such companies would bring the benefits of division of labor to the company scale, leveraging economies of scale to their advantage and reducing overhead substantially for other companies.

Establishing the fact that it is always the better option to allow such businesses to take over for processes and roles that they are better equipped to fill ensures that the aforementioned business strategy is reliable, which enables the overall economic advantages of said strategy to be fully realized.

The incentives to keep a company open to external assistance would also be present to enable integration of any company which can assist any part of their operation indirectly in a way that is capable of increasing the productivity of other companies by various other means, be it through improved management, specific types of training, streamlining processes, providing access to various systems, increasing workplace enjoyment and motivation, or whatever else they do that is able to improve operations of various companies, so as to further the sophistication and development in how industry operates as a whole.

In this way, the economy would form a cohesive structure of interchangeable and replaceable parts, enabling far more capabilities than could otherwise have been enabled. Far more variety would be introduced. Economic diversity would be increased significantly.

Trade and collaboration between, among, and across industries would dramatically increase, which would result in more efficient economic allocation, more rapid economic development, and an overall more well-organized, flexible, and thus reliable economic system.

However, that is not all. It does not end there. This also creates a system immune to monopoly, at least in its malignant form.

If a monopoly forms, it must make sure to stay effective at its job of serving the needs of society most effectively in every single branch and sector, or it will slowly be replaced, piece by piece, by other companies which are able to perform the roles in those areas more effectively than the original company itself, possibly to the point where it is entirely replaced.
If a company has to permanently halt operations, for any given reason, there will always be other companies prepared to pick up their slack, so that the economy operates in a continuum, and so that there is no excessive reliance on the existing leadership and employees of a given company, as neither should be given undue political leverage over a system which must remain consistent to operate, to better prevent the likelihood of the occurrence of economic hostage situations and rent-seeking in general.

Any weak links in the economy would generally be strengthened by the fact that there will always be a backup company prepared to take over operations.

## Analytical Awareness

It is important for any political organization to be aware of how things around them work. As such, it would be a good idea to record the strategies, structures, modes of operation, and behaviors of as many government agencies, corporations, NGOs, politicians, celebrities, and other significant entities as possible, prioritizing with the most significant.

Many opportunities exist, but an organization must be aware of them to make any use of them. Many dangers exist, so an organization must be aware of them to avoid them.

The goal is to know who is a potential ally, who is a threat, which weaknesses or short sights can be exploited in the framework, and how to interact with the general surroundings to best succeed overall.

This includes making use of any tools provided by the existing framework as intelligently as possible, using its resources whenever doing so is the advantageous.

## An Open Economy

The entrepreneurial spirit – something frequently overrated, underrated, and everything in between…

At the end of the day, though, enabling people to act on their creative ambitions is vital to economic improvement, so this spirit should not be quelled, nor should it be discouraged.

Within the current capitalist economic system, an entrepreneur can be anything from an inventor to a scammer. This probably isn’t the end of the world, but it isn’t ideal by any stretch of the imagination – regardless of how much creative ambition one has.

The problem in the current economy isn’t just the lack of restraint regarding which business ventures can be pursued, but also the lack of support for business ventures as a whole.

I have already outlined other solutions to the former, and now it’s time to address the latter.

It may be true that registration for businesses is made as easy as possible in the current system, along with various other policies intended to encourage new businesses, but such is inadequate and also has various negative consequences. Let’s consider other possible routes.

Many people have remarkable business ideas, but simply don’t know how to either start or run a business themselves. The ability to do so is vital if one wants to turn these ideas into a reality, something which is important for economic development, diversity, and innovation in general.

As such, this is a place where providing assistance would be in the best interests of the economy in general, which includes everyone within it.

To assist such endeavors, the economic system should integrate startup farms into its design. That is, entities which manage, organize, and operate startups under a standardized framework.

Analogous to server hosting clients, such an entity would provide the necessary infrastructure and maintenance for small businesses.

Additionally, they would allow a startup founder to arrange and customize their business using a intuitive interface built to work with the standardized framework to make the process of company organization and management simple and flexible.

Once a startup grows too big for the startup farm, it must then develop its own specialized facilities and move out.

Once outside of the standardized and monolithic system of pooled management, it gains more organizational and structural freedom, enabling higher efficiency of operations.

Upon moving out, it would be connected to an interconnected network of businesses and regulatory systems, as mandated.

Said network would be used for sharing industry standards, best practices, and innovations, as well as submitting legally required information such as bureaucratic structure, including the role of each employee, recorded progress/productivity for each employee, and various other orders of business which outline the state of affairs.

It would be required to report on the details of each and every process, product, component, incident, and anything else relevant to company operations, with this process built into the system and made as convenient as possible.

This would be alongside systems increasing the ease insider reporting, as well as periodic inspections carried out occasionally, to verify the accuracy of the provided information.

Said details would be open to the public, and people would then be able to submit proposals for further innovations and improvements to a company, given this information, into the network, in any process, product, component, etcetera.

These innovations and improvements would be implemented, provided the resulting advantages justifies the upfront cost of implementation, and a sizable percentage of the calculated net value gained upon implementation would be automatically and continuously wired to the individual or group that submitted the innovation.

Such is also the nature of how a company would begin as well. A plan, an idea, or whatever else underlies the basis one has for starting a company, would be submitted to the network.

These would be reviewed by experienced experts, who would then report back to the individual and provide their analysis. Questions would be asked about areas which lack sufficient consideration or explanation.

Recommendations would be given to address deficiencies and/or mention further improvements which are possible.

If the basis for starting a company is deemed sufficient, and the owner hasn’t delayed to make potential further improvements mentioned, then a section of the startup farm is allocated for the new company, and the company starts its operation.

## Modular Mobility

I asked myself the following question: How can the convenience of driving be combined with the efficiency and throughput of a train?

It took some time, but surprisingly, I was able to brute-force a solution in my head simply by thinking about it long enough and hard enough, all miraculously without losing patience.

The influence of drugs may or may not have played a role in this process. For any further information on this subject, I plead the fifth.

The realization was that with standardized cabs built to carry individual passengers, and a multi-modal network of interconnected transit lines, all of which run vehicles that carry these standardized cabs, it would be possible to seamlessly transport people, using various modes of transit, to whichever end destination these lines touch.

This would, of course, require a routing and tracking system, a method of efficient loading and unloading of cabs, and a way to store these cabs. So, how we would do that?

First, a routing and tracking system must be implemented to perform many critical functions. It must coordinate all the cabs in the system and ensure that no single train, bus, tram, plane, or any other vehicle is sent more cabs than it has the capacity for.

Each cab would have a unique identifier for the system to check, ensuring it is the right one, and in the right place, so cabs don’t get misidentified and sent to the wrong place.

Passengers would choose their destination beforehand, and it would ensure that the cab actually arrives at the place chosen by the passenger.

It would also account for times of peak usage by recording usage patterns, so it can use that data to better route cabs and inform people when they should postpone non-essential travel.

In doing so, it would prevent the transportation networks from being saturated by excessive numbers of cabs being transported at times of peak usage.

The cabs would be designed to be able to connect to, and detach from, a type of mount designed to be used in all compatible vehicles. There would also need to be machines and/or infrastructure capable of quickly, smoothly, and reliably unloading, transferring, and loading cabs at transfer stations positioned between different modes of transport, such as trains, buses, trams, and planes among other things.

These cabs would be transferred smoothly and efficiently between various modes of transport, all of which would be specially designed to carry a given amount of them, to get to a final destination chosen by the passenger when they initiated the trip.

Additionally, there should be systems, infrastructure, and machines which are able to temporarily store and retrieve cabs when needed.

This could be set up similar to how the automatic car storage systems in Japan are set up, but since the cabs are, obviously, modular, and thus standardized, there would be significantly less complexity.

Because of that, as well as the cab’s smaller size, carrying capacity of these cab storage systems would be significantly more, as the cabs would not only be smaller than cars, but they would also be easy to densely pack close together.

Also, the machine would theoretically not even have to keep track of the cabs, given that each cab has a unique identifier which can be scanned, and a GPS locator which could potentially direct the machine to a given cab.

The cabs themselves would have similar properties to a car. They would be owned by the individuals that use them.

Various types could be sold and purchased, to account for different uses and user preferences, so long as they meet regulations and work within the standards set.

They could also be personalized, so long as such personalization does not include modifications to the exterior, frame, or structure of the cab without a license and proper equipment to do so.
Such antics could cause malfunctions and errors, resulting in damage to the cab, the networks, and possibly the driver as well.

Modifications or customizations which have no practical effect, on the other hand, would be permitted and would not require extra certification.

Such a system would hold the most commonly mentioned advantages held by cars. Personalization and freedom, door-to-door convenience, flexible travel, storage capacity, privacy and comfort, and availability in remote areas. The ability for personalization is as mentioned above.

Door-to-door convenience would be a result of allowing for different modes of transport to fill various roles, some of which are capable of connecting to single homes and other buildings while remaining practical, and would likely be used for that purpose (while also being much more cost-effective than roads or driveways).

Flexible travel would be enabled by the flexibility of the network, of course. Storage capacity can be increased by activating a storage cab, or possibly a few of them, to travel with the passenger cab that one is using.

Privacy and comfort would be maintained, as passenger cabs would be built, within the standards and regulations, in many different configurations of interior and overall design, optionally including windows, entertainment systems, and anything else which suits the owner’s preferences for both privacy and comfort.

Of course, it would be available in any remote areas that any transportation mode within the network is capable of expanding to, while also accounting for cost.

Remember how packet switching was the technology which made the internet possible? This would make it possible to create a new internet, but this time for transportation, enabling transport modes previously inconceivable.

The internet may be complex, but it is also the most efficient way we are able to give and receive information.
Before it came about, the modes of information sharing, like radio, television, newspapers, magazines, books, and word of mouth, were much more restricted.

It also ushered in the creation of Wi-Fi, cellular internet networks, fiber optic cables, search engines, and much more.

This could very much do the same thing for transportation. You’re welcome, urban planning community. Have fun with this.
