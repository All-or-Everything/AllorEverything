# Intramutualism: A New Economic System
## Changes
- Open Innovation: Intellectual property is dropped entirely. Instead, inventors and potential sponsors are acknowledged in the filing of an invention, but not given exclusive control over its use. Instead, to incentivize innovation, there are direct funding incentives. These would actually produce more concrete incentives, because they mean that inventors could actually make a living off of their inventions without taking excessive risk or requiring excessive up-front investment. Being an inventor would finally be an actual stable job, and companies could compete fairly without patent battles. Public databases would freely allow access and use of the greatest innovations of humanity. Also, schooling quality would dramatically increase, as all the proprietary information in textbooks and other paid courses would, by the nature of this policy, be phased out and replaced with Open Educational Resources (OER) alongside, which are higher quality and free for public access.
- Standardization: Do we really need 500 different kind of power tool batteries and chargers when one would suffice? As the logical next step to supplanting intellectual property, the pool of open innovation are drawn from to form industry standards across industries, which are enforced, ensuring compatibility between products regardless of producer. 
- Priority: Instead of stockholder return on investment and profitability largely determining the amount that can be spent developing the capacity to produce something, the return on investment for the good of society would determine the level of funds granted, accounting for indirect effects. With this would come the need for new, more complicated metrics of value to be created. While difficult, it is necessary, as it would task us with figuring out how to determine value with consistency in general. The resulting metrics, when informing decisions, would serve a lot more essential human needs than metrics like GDP, reflecting more accurately the lived experience and quality of life, both of which would be pursued more directly and thus improved significantly as a result, bringing productivity and innovation up with it.
Services like Wikipedia, which provide greater economic benefit than they could ever recieve in standard capitalism, would increase in numbers and funding.. exponentially. The greater good would become the most successful business plan to pursue in such an economy. There would be no more lying public relations team that hides atrocities, because moral and progressive goals would be the uniting base of all businessmen. Also, investors would still be in luck. They would work alongside economists as the deciding parties behind investment and funds allocation in the economy, but with different incentives now.
It would be a system where the government supports the economy, the economy supports the people, and the people support both. It is truly intramutual, where all sectors unite for the common good to benefit all.



It may have some similar aspects to Socialism, though it was inspired partially by [some ideas from different economic systems and theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_economics) off of Wikipedia, and boy are there a lot of those.

However, I did not really use any single theory as my baseline. Instead, I asked myself a question: What would the most efficient model for economic activity and development look like?

In standard capitalism, the dominant economic practice, perverse incentives shoot up like weeds everywhere. This system demonstrates a better option to what is currently in place, as it would remove these perverse incentives, weeding out:
- Scams like bait & switch, NFT grifting, among many other annoying and/or shady practices that rely on misleading advertising.
- Pharmeceutical profiteering, which comes at at the expense of those suffering from debilitating illnesses.
- The requirement of individual payment for simple online services of low cost and general public benifit. Think paywalls.
- The over-proliferation of advertisements shown instead of, as a barrier to reaching, or distracting from, the relavent content.
- The excessive focus on profits over usefulness, curating products to get people to pay more for them rather than for them to be more useful. Think smartphone manufacturers removing the headphone jack and SD card slot when these components offer far more functionality and present negligible downsides, simply to juice sales of their more profitable bluetooth headphones lineups (which provide lower quality audio fundimentally due to the medium of transfer) and their more expensive, higher storage capacity phone models.
- The ability of intellectual property holders to sue or charge royalties for a wide range of things, including even simply singing the song "Happy Birthday" in public.
- The incentive for companies to make so you can't fix products [that you paid for](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair), as well as the ability for them to even do so to begin with.

It was implied but not stated that there would be less inequality in such a system. The system would, in any case, trend towards equality if implemented. Less inequality is more efficient in economics for the following reasons:
 - Resource allocation is much more efficient and fair. Because there is not as large of a divide between rich and poor, there would be less people spending money on extravagant things that aren't of much practical value simply because they have too much money to know how to use properly, and at the same time more people with financial means to pay for basic needs and achieve further growth (reducing poverty as well).
 - It helps prevent oligarchy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_law_of_oligarchy)
 - It keeps the motives of the economy aligned with the motives of the people.
 - It provides political stability.
 - It's simply more fair.
I came up with these on the fly, without looking anything up, so there are very likely many more reasons. Simply put, there are many practical and evolutionary reasons equality is a moral value.

Note also that there will be no economic system designed by me, be it this or any other, that will include intellectual property as it currently stands because:
- It stifles innovation despite incentivizing it, by preventing the widespread implimentation of, or further innovation on, previous inventions.
- It is incredibly difficult to regulate in a way that is fair for everyone, because the conflicts between patents create gray areas on top of gray areas.
- It is anticompetitive by nature, a quality which is fundimentally incompatible with a balanced market system.
- The reward for a given invention is more random, and rather than being aligned with the benifit derived from its use, it's more so determined by how saavy one is at marketing their invention.
- Sharing ideas is what makes society progress. Hoarding ideas, as with hoarding anything else in the economy, makes things worse.
- The most common usage of intellectual property in modern times runs starkly counter to the initial intentions of the concept, as it is commonly and increasingly misused by large corperations to maintain monopolies by gaining strategic leverage over other companies, rather than to provide a reward to small innovators, and the actual inventors nowadays are individuals working at these monopolies who get no rights to their creations.
That is not to say there should be no program in place to benefit the inventor of the idea, but that the system must be well thought out.


This economic system runs on a self-balancing system of currency, like capitalism, but the incentives are held under strong collective control. This is done through a sophisticated system of measurement, calculation, and calibration, and the prices are regulated so that the profit margin matches the value provided to the buyer in their good or service. Likewise, the provision of goods and services are subsidized according to their positive externalities for the public, and taxed according to their negative externalities.

Demonstrative example: There is a database of knowledge that anyone can access. However, much of the information is technical and advanced, thus discouraging the average person from using it for their ideas. If indications predict that providing a more intuitive and approachable system to interact with this information is in the best interests of the people, and would give more to society (in positive externalities) than it would take away (in time and costs) such a system would be developed. Supply follows societal demands.

Many ideas have been thought up and subsequently dismissed because although they would benefit society (and the economy) as a whole, they would not turn a profit. These are good ideas that are wasted, discarded as useless by companies who cannot monetize the public good.

Capitalism has its benefits, absolutely. It's not adequate anymore though. It has been milked dry over the past centuries and is stagnating. The opposite of stagnation is change, which is best done with eyes clear of ideological dogmas. I don't care if an economy is capitalism or socialism or any other ideology for that matter: I care if it works.

Now, assuming one could distribute wealth to a population, how would it be distributed most efficiently to achieve the greater good? I realized that, assuming everyone has average intelligence (IQ settles into a normal distribution, or 'bell curve' in reality), it would be most efficient to distribute funds equally, as everyone can allocate funds optimally with equal funds given equal intelligence. This would improve a society dramatically... if it was a monolith. Society is, howerver, not a monolith, and this in practice would be a bad idea, providing no incentive for individuals to contribute in any way to the system they depend on to stay alive.

That being said, there is a place where equality is well suited. Consider the things in the economy which are too critical, when it comes to enabling the bare minimum of a humane existence, to withhold from anyone, period. These things must always be provided without cost and under no circumstances be withheld for the purpose of increasing worker incentive. In effect, witholding these things result in a form of coercion which can be summed up as blackmail-induced slavery. It is well known that, regardless of the form, and regardless of the mechanisms facilitating it, slavery degrades both the people and the economy itself. Desperation is not a sustainable or acceptable incentive.

We need our needs met without excuses or delays. This is the most fundimentally important aspect for any society to prioritize. In light of this, let's consider a policy to do so. To provide for our most fundimental basic needs, we need Universal Basic Necessities. UBN is a policy of providing all the basic necessities for life such as food, water, shelter, education, healthcare, and any other non-negotiable human needs, without question or hesitation. This provides a stable base to build a strong economy off of.

This, however, is not where we end, because even while UBN is implimented, it remains useful to provide everyone a baseline average allowance, calculated in order to leverage some advantages of the increase in resource distribution efficiency. This is Universal Basic Income, and it helps redistribute wealth to those that it means the most to. This should be implimented with due consideration that it is balanced, without too significantly diminishing the incentive to be productive within the economy, while also providing everyone with an allowance.

Incentives could come in the form of the currently existing system, but there are more clever and effective ways to implement incentives. When an individual makes an invention or does a project (or really just anything) that is helpful to society and/or economic progress, they could be compensated for it in cash and social status, by both institutions built for that purpose and maybe also other people if they choose to do so, because gratitude is good for society. It could even lead to a culture of paying back good deeds in full, strengthening cohesion in communities and giving those that engage in such projects a driving social motivation from the knowledge people support their ventures, along with the material support and incentive already in place.

Those that are successful would be the inspiration and example for the following ventures, which would build upon the work of previous startups. Corporations could sprout up to increase efficiency and thus funding and status of the founder, and all workers would get paid well so long as they are contributing to society in their role. The founder would also get a bonus per person that is contributing to society more efficiently than they would be doing otherwise without the company. This is somewhat capitalist and socialist (i.e. owners own their companies, but within boundaries. Strict limitations are in place to prevent abuse of power; competition happens - and it happens more efficiently, towards progress, thanks to the recalibration of incentives; people can earn more money by working harder - so long as their work actually benifits others;) so this shows promise towards fixing the problems of capitalism. For inventions, they would be open to public use and access but would give credit to the inventor. The inventor would then be compensated based on predictions of how much their invention has improved society, which means that not only would there be incentives for inventions, but also that they would mainly be geared towards the common good.

Essentially, in a system that rewards good deeds the amount of effort geared towards helping the greater good would skyrocket. For once, we could all be on the same page.

Further on the topic of wage distribution, how should one distribute pay? Well, it would be calculated by the statistics division of government. All companies would have to report sales and other metrics to the analytics division of government, which would use those and many other factors in calculations in order to make sound economic predictions and provide an optimal economic plan for the greater good of society, including where money goes, how much, and other factors. Machine learning technology would likely be utilized to reduce workload and increase effectiveness.

On a different note, in my drawing I drew the 'communication and oversight' branch of government being connected to each other branch of government. That is actually not arbitrary, but it would be functional in order to make sure all information passes through the same place so information is well organized and multilateral, it would change the conditions so political power is nearly impossible to acquire within the government, and it would dramatically simplify the process of making decisions. Also, the government would be designed so that mistakes, lies, or corruption would be easily detected and managed.


#### Financial Fabrication
The money in the economy should not be mistaken as the economy itself, just as a map should not be mistaken as the terrain itself. GDP is not as important as social outcomes that have tangible effects on people's lives.


## The Economy and Time

In the economy time is, in many practical ways, similar to any spatial dimension. For example, in its simplest manifestation, expanding a farm by a factor of 2 in any one dimension will double output, as would increasing it by 2 temporally (i.e. twice the speed).

The difference between time and other dimensions is that with more complex systems, differences of functionality occur. If we look at a microprocessor, increasing speed will increase the amount of instructions per second. However, increasing size can increase the amount of memory stored and the complexity of the calculations it is capable of performing, which translates to increasing the amount of instructions per second and possibly more functional diversity.

Similar to the clock speed vs core count, the speed of any system almost always reaches a point where increasing it any further breaks things, and the scale of a system is always limited by the ability to co-ordinate all the different parts of the system. Speed in a sector can be increased marginally by finding shortcuts (i.e. innovations that remove, replace, or speed up part of the process), improving quality (via training, improved protocols, higher skill workers, etc.), or by cutting corners (lowering quality, not recommended except for in areas that are non-critical and/or excessively over-engineered/over-emphasized to little gain), which will increase output.

Size is simply increased by increasing the scale of a sector. This means that with more workers, provided co-ordination and management are sufficient, there will be more output (whether that output is innovation, production, or some other economic good), more rapid development, and other advantages caused by network effect/the fact that people were biologically designed with the capacity to scale up into communities. Effects like these can be seen in many places in the economy, and for such reasons coordination is of great importance.


## Encompassing Economics

The economy encompasses all. Not many bother with the small details, but they add up. For example, in the U.S. we have a poorly functioning justice system that arrests 5x the international average. Many of these are people that could otherwise be contributing to the economy, but instead they are held in custody, which actually costs a significant amount, especially for the poor treatment the prisoners get out of it.

It also encompasses school, where teachers teach and students learn. The effect the teaching has on the students will have a subsequent effect on the economy, so lessons should be high quality, and good schooling should be accessible to all regardless of socioeconomic status.

Even things seemingly unrelated such as health, social justice, political stability, and social investment can have an impact on the economy. Wars, politics, culture, ideology, climate, and other factors all play a large role in shaping what the economy looks like. There is almost nothing that does not affect the economy to some extent, whether it be a new discovery, a popular trend, a geopolitical event, etcetera. The question is, what kind of effects can these events have? Which help and which hinder the economy?

How can we elegantly intertwine politics, geography, and all other factors with the economy, such that the optimal actions are persued for the good of all?



## Concepts of Collective Convenience

### Dinner Delivery

We have limited time, and every bit of time spent on meaningful things in life is important. Additionally,  not all of us like having too many choices to choose between, as it saturates our thought processes. For that reason, I think it would be ideal to have a system of getting meals directly.

I dislike the fact that, even with modern-day convenience, the closest thing we have to my ideal system, as far as I am aware, is the company Hello Fresh. Not really a good start. I dislike Hello Fresh for several reasons, but it will serve as a good comparison to demonstrate how I conceptualize this direct meal system.

First, let's talk about the food served. I don't like the food that Hello Fresh provides. My parents had a subscription to it for a while, and the experience was mediocre at best. The food was not good, in my experience, because it consisted of meals I could not pronounce or recognize, which also tasted strange to me, and not in a good way. Additionally, the food was not pre-prepared, thus ruining the point of the service to begin with. At that point why not just buy the ingredients from the supermarket?

A meal distribution system in Intramutualism would have pre-prepared, cooked food. The food of choice could potentially be selected among a group of popular options, subject to public preference, and would be cooked locally. It would likely be more readily available in cities, as it would be easier to distribute food to many in a dense urban environment, but with good logistics it could potentially be a possibility in the country as well. This would save a significant amount of time having to go grocery shopping, preparing food, and cleaning up afterwards.

Even with it being more convenient, the quality of food would likely be better anyway, thus one does not need to sacrifice quality for convenience. One can have both. One can additionally have healthy food that also tastes good, thus helping with current health issues. Of course, one could skip the convenience and just buy from the store, but most would likely opt for the convenient option. It would make food distribution more efficient.

If it's good food and people like it it, they may decide to have all of their meals provided the meal distribution system. This removes the need to have an oven or to cook, for the most part, and thus houses can be a bit smaller, less cluttered, and more manageable. It also means far less pantry space would be needed, refrigerators would not need to be as large, the oven, stovetop, and/or microwave may be unneeded, food would spoil less while in storage, and saved time means people could focus their efforts in other places, which inevitably improves the economy, as well as quality of life.


### Helping Homes

Additionally, services that help with things like home management and organization would be important as well. They have many tangible benefits both personal and economical. For what reason should we think only we alone can manage our lives, even if it is in chaos? Because that is what is expected. It is, however, not necessary, indeed not even desirable, if one wants to be able to manage their life without falling apart.

Unlike having a (notably toxic and exploitative) self-help industry, we could have an industry that specializes on actually helping people improve their daily lives, whether it be by relaying tangible life skills that are proven to be helpful, by organizing and/or reorganizing everything from someone's house to their computer files, and all in between. This means helping people with skills they need for day-to-day life to make it easier, thus freeing up time and improving things economically and personally.

Things like these can't currently be pursued with plain capitalism because capitalism asks for an immediate monetary reward. Intramutualism has a specific focus how things effect the economy as a whole. It is more based on systems science. As such, things that don't net capital but do improve the economy as a whole will be pursued, thus it is unlikely to put profit over people and the overall economy. Also, upwards mobility is baked into the system.

> The founder would also get a bonus per person that is contributing to society more efficiently than they would be doing otherwise without the company.

This means that if a company is more efficiently contributing to society than some other company, that company is incentivised to hire those that are working in less efficient jobs. Because workers would be paid a majority percentage of the value their work, more efficient work means a higher paying job. In both cases, incentives select for greater efficiency/effectiveness along with increasing wages. Also, bringing a worker from a higher efficiency job to a lower efficiency job would likely carry a penalty, and it would also pay a lower wage, so lowering wages would be selected against. Importantly, it would actively bring people from low-productivity jobs into higher-productivity jobs. This is like the free hand of the market, except instead of only balancing supply and demand (to some extent) , it would also select for increasing efficiency, wages, and societal benefit.

# Mission

## Organizing an Outcome

Many a person I have spoken with in my own life, and many I find that see freedom where there is none, only pointing out the benevolent traits of the malevolent system, relying on their own confirmation bias to guide them forward on the endless path of conformity and servitude.

Why do such people only see good in the system that takes from them their futures, their humanity, and their freedom? Are they not aware of their rights, of their best interests, and of their morals?

Those that are aware of the societal state of affairs frequently take action in the form of protest, and I understand why people would go this route if the situation is desperate, or if they are uneducated, but why has such a route become the dominant approach in an educated society with plenty of time to be able to get coordinated and make further plans?

One does not fight the government to make positive change, one becomes the government. Their own government. That is what organizing is about. Organizing is not about causing chaos within the current order, organizing is about bringing about a fairer order.

It is not about destroying the prevailing order. It is about forming a new order that eclipses it. It is not about fighting power structures; it is about creating your own which surpass them.

The state has a monopoly on violence. Unless an organization has the means at hand to overwhelm the state’s monopoly on violence, and thus acquire the title of monopoly on violence for themselves, something which would take an immense quantity of resources to the point where it is essentially an unfeasible goal, there is not really a way to succeed on this route.

It will most certainly not work, in this case, for one to protest or to take militant action to achieve progress or go beyond the status quo, except through the political effect that a mass display of discontent has on the population, which itself is quite limited.

To go beyond the current system, one must create a system that is capable of doing what it does, and one which also has structural and organizational advantages over it. One can then use the weaknesses, accumulated within the current system over centuries, to consume it, taking in its constituents and resources alike.

Then from the old system’s remains can arise a much stronger, fairer system. That is how a peaceful revolution can take place. By acting, as a system, with diligence, honesty, responsibility, altruism, wisdom, fairness, social intelligence, proportionality, and respect for the lives of all, such a system can gain more power.

By gaining more credibility, authority, popularity, power, and relevance in the minds and hearts of the people, the new system can eclipse the authority of the old, which slowly dissolves as it becomes irrelevant and is replaced by a better order. An order which has earned the respect of the people after the old order lost their trust.


## Providing Power

To make mankind achieve the greatest level of power possible, we must move past the zero-sum approach, instead maximizing the potential of every single person in the world.

That would probably mean taking an approach to power that is quite the opposite of current approaches.

It would mean giving people more rights, opportunities, and things of significant human value like health care, drinking water, food, and social connections, all without being asked.

It means giving resources to people whose existence you were previously unaware of, and, on the flip side, getting resources from people whose existence you were previously unaware of, through mutually beneficial or at times altruistic transactions and investments.

In this, our goal isn't just to increase the power of individuals, but of humanity as a whole.



## Reinstating Relationship Reliability

We will always be dependent on others for our ongoing survival, but it is when malevolence, incompetence, and overall unreliability becomes a part of this relationship that problems occur.

It is not our dependence on people or systems that is the problem. It is our dependence on people or systems that are untrustworthy or unreliable.

If such systems do not exist which are reliable then it is our moral obligation to create new ones which are. This is for the benefit of all, because through the building of a new system, one frees people to live independently from the existing, unreliable systems. Everyone is better off with the presence of such an opportunity.

We know already that monopolies are bad for everyone who relies on them, but what happens when the entire economic and political system of an entire country maintains a power dynamic between itself and its citizens which is analogous to a monopoly?

Just as the owners of a monopoly will leverage their positions to benefit themselves, so too do those in the governmental and institutional positions which make up the dominant economic and political system.

This makes the system unreliable, untrustworthy, and ineffective at performing the roles it is supposed to perform, slowly guiding it on a more malevolent path. As such, it would be of the public interest that a new system be formed to provide an alternative to such an unreliable and untrustworthy system.

We do not, in our own life, allow someone we do not trust to play an important role in our lives. We would not willingly entrust our livelihood in the hands of someone who only has an interest in benefiting themselves. Why, then, should we entrust our collective livelihoods in a system that has proven time and time again to be unreliable and untrustworthy?

We shouldn’t. We should instead find or create a system that is reliable and trustworthy. Just as it is detrimental, as an individual, to have to depend on someone that cannot be trusted, so also is it detrimental to depend, as a collective, on a system which cannot be trusted.

We are all a part of the system we live within, even if we have little say in how it is run. What some may not consider, though, is that our organization determines the very nature of the system we live within.

We could, for example, contradict, subvert, and ultimately leverage the logic that the current system runs on, of our own will, and in doing so change it, and be much better off for taking such actions. It was through doing so, after all, which enabled the very first strikes, boycotts, and worker’s movements.

In our case, though, we need not even pursue such confrontational approaches when we can simply create our own systems, formed around our own social contracts to facilitate our own goals, where we set the terms and conditions. By doing so, we could bring about an alternative system - one which is actually capable of facilitating mutually beneficial relationships amongst ourselves and those around us, to the ultimate growth and further success of the movement we together amount to.

Relationship problems often occur among people when trust is not maintained, which result in tensions and disagreements. Those same problems can also occur between people and systems under similar circumstances.

People should have the option to cut ties in an abusive relationship with a system, and form new, healthier relationships with a different system.

They should not be forced to endure ongoing abuse for their entire working lives without being given another relationship option. There must be a second option, and we must enable it ourselves. Such is our moral imperative.

# Context

## From Inspiration to Initiative

I leveraged many of the insights I gained from an ambitious game mod project of mine, Stranded II Enhanced, when forming the ideas and frameworks which inspired this server. In Stranded II, I organized the folder for 3d model/texture/icon files for easier management early on, as my first task, splitting a large and cluttered pile of resources into an organized structure of associated file groups according to the same naming scheme present in the system files, so I could locate 3D models, textures, and icons according to their corresponding category.

I then proceeded to integrate parts of a different mod, Stranded 2.5, into the game files. Stranded 2.5 had far better 3d models than the original for many objects and entities in the game, but was in German, and lacked specific functionalities present in the original game for no evident reason. As such, I replaced many of the existing 3d models in my mod with 3d models from this mod, the end result being better graphics without compromise.

I then took my mod and integrated it into the platforms of other mods, which had different source code revisions of the actual game file itself, which took a while but was ultimately successful. I created the lite and the + version of my mod, the lite version having no additional stuff added to it, just improved graphics and general enhancement. The + version of it, however, I didn't hold back on.

I went through existing mods one by one, incorporating anything with enough quality to meet my standards into my mod, and leaving the scraps and defects behind. I did this until the point at which there were no mods left to take stuff from, having gone through a few dozen of them, and during this process I also improved many of the 3d models and scripts for various things in the game, and turned various poorly functioning, conceptual systems into well-functioning features of the game, completing the old dreams of abandoned projects.

And then, I learned how to compile the source code, and things intensified. I took the source code for s2boost, a version that ran faster and fixed a problem with the game textures turning black, and the source code for stranded II multiplayer, which added multiplayer functionality. I merged them with WinMerge, one section at a time, and miraculously, despite literally being a code Frankenstein of the two, it ran without a single error on the first run.

If you haven't figured out the reason behind the name I use, it shouldn't be hard to now.

By this time, I had developed a proficiency for integrating systems, even conflicting and seemingly incompatible ones. I had developed an appreciation for just what can be created when one has ambition, a large pool of free resources, and a bit of free time on their hands. Importantly, I expanded my imagination, conjuring creative concepts and subsequently implementing them. I began to think, I began to perceive, I began to feel reward, through the lens of systems.

I became interested in physics at some point, jumping from model to model, from framework to framework, learning and forming associations, observing patterns, experiencing intense moments of epiphany, and, at some point in time, formalizing my internalized framework of physics. Then I showed it to some people and received a weak response. I began questioning the value in my idea, realizing that, even if entirely accurate, my model would still improve little on the refined methods already in use.

And then I asked myself a question.

Knowing my own intellectual capacity, what area should I seek to develop, in order to make the most of my abilities in achieving a positive impact?

I settled on economics.

I created the early layout of a system, which I showed on an online forum, and to some acquaintances of mine. One of them told me I should write a book.
It sounded like a good way to get more of my ideas down, without having to cut everything out. 
So I did. I wrote over 120 pages of works, and created a discord server to collaborate on them and improve them with others, with the realization that I could more effectively actualize my aspirations online, with far less resources, more connectivity, and easier expansion, to fully formulate the ideological foundation of the movement, and bring awareness to it in the process. 

It took to the point where I had already built a discord server around it and accumulated over 200 members before realizing that a book was not really the goal I had in mind, due to various reasons. I had already planned on making it free to distribute anyway, and I came to realize that it was insanely inefficient for others to get value out of the works in book format, so I took the book and split it into segments, and created a new server, purpose-built to contain them and the works of others. I took all of the individual segments from the book, refined them, and posted them separately so they could be more easily accessed, organized, searched, and maintained.

It was not long before I realized this also was not enough. We needed a platform that would properly allow versioning, structuring, and merging of ideological frameworks, and this is where github came to mind.

So that is what we used.


## Surmounting Systemic Cynicism

Allow me to introduce you to some revelations of mine, which provided me with insight and inspiration that was instrumental to the formation of the All or Everything movement...

As humans, we're most interested in ourselves.

I decided long ago that I was going to dedicate my time and effort towards achieving societal goals. Rather than working my days away at a job, I poured my time and effort into a movement. People saw my approach as backwards. I should be spending my time chasing a career, working 9-5, or going to college, before pursuing such passions, right?

Wrong. This is the correct approach. It only appears backwards coming from the perspective of the majority of a society reliant on a backwards approach. These things, they are what everyone else is doing. Pursuing individual interests, disconnected from the system within which they are pursued, as overall conditions continuously worsen.

Very few people are dedicating their time and effort towards creating and implementing effective solutions to global and systemic issues plaguing humanity and diminishing our prospects worldwide, both individually and collectively.

As humans, we see things on an individual level, guided by individual interests, finding little interest in pursuing things outside of the individual level. Humanity exists on the global level, as an interconnected collection of individuals, the majority of whom hold little interest or perspective outside themselves and their own day-to-day lives.

So, I can spend my time working within this system, or I can spend my time forming frameworks and gathering people together into an effective and interconnected movement, where we can bring about an entirely new system which runs more efficiently and solves the problems of the current system.

We do not go about solving our problems using the same thinking that created our problems.
