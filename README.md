# AllorEverything

Collaborative creation of more effective and ethical societal structures and likewise strategies to bring them about. Existence goes on whether we like it or not. Let's change it for the better.


### Project Objective
Our goal is to collaboratively develop the All or Everything Societal System, as well as an encompassing ecosystem of information which contains the means to bring it about. To this end, this repo contains multiple directories that are external to the AoE Societal System central project directory:
- Resources: Showcases the efforts by many independently operating individuals in imagining a better world, displaying a multitude of independently developed concepts, policies, and systems. This will serve as the metaphorical food trough to provide idea fodder in the development of the AoE Societal System. Part of this project will consist of taking concepts and proposals contained in this directory and integrating them into the AoESS within the central directory.
- .obsidian: This contains Obsidian themes, plugins, and settings which have been thoroughly reviewed and will serve to expand the function of this repository so that it's both a github repository and a downloadable Obsidian vault that, when downloaded and unzipped, can be opened by Obsidian using the option "Open folder as vault" to an envoronment that is consistent across collaborators. Make sure to enable community plugins! Download Obsidian Here -> https://obsidian.md/download
